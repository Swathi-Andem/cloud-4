    <content type="html"><![CDATA[For this release we put a lot of focus on finishing our async upgrade and fix a bunch of bugs in the process.

But a new release wouldn't be awesome if it didn't had some new goodies and this release is no different. This release includes a new calendar component by [@mnestor]. It comes now with Google Calendar support, which should allow you to automate things based on your calendar events!

### <a class='title-link' name='release-0331---november-20' href='#release-0331---november-20'></a> Release 0.33.1 - November 20 

 - Fix Z-Wave lights ([@turbokongen])

### <a class='title-link' name='release-0332---november-22' href='#release-0332---november-22'></a> Release 0.33.2 - November 22 

 - Fix Device Tracker init ([@pvizeli])
 - Fix Discovery init ([@pvizeli])
 - Fix TP-Link switch ([@mweinelt])
 - Fix Zwave light naming & configurable refresh ([@jchapple])

### <a class='title-link' name='release-0333---november-23' href='#release-0333---november-23'></a> Release 0.33.3 - November 23 

 - Update Yr.no entities every hour ([@kellerza])
 - Bump Netdisco to 0.7.7 (fixes discovery on Synology)
 - Fix discovery race condition (most obvious in Wemo) ([@balloob])

### <a class='title-link' name='breaking-changes' href='#breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes 

 - We have included a fix that impacts how we generate entity ids. This only impacts devices with accented characters. Instead of being stripped out, they are now replaced with the non-accented version. So now `T√®st M√∂r√™` will become `test_more` instead of `tst_mr`.
 - Command line switches will now use the specified object ID for their entity ID instead of basing it off the name.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Another two weeks have passed and we are pleased to present Home Assistant 0.32.

### <a class='title-link' name='hacktoberfest' href='#hacktoberfest'></a> Hacktoberfest 
The [Hacktoberfest] is over now. Home Assistant made the 2nd and the 3rd place out of almost 30'000 participating repositories with a total of 528 pull requests closed - that's an average of 17 pull requests a day! Thanks to all the contributors but also to the team of reviewers. This wouldn't been possible without you üëè .

### <a class='title-link' name='improved-error-reporting' href='#improved-error-reporting'></a> Improved error reporting 
This release has improved the reporting when a config validation error occurs. Thanks to [@kellerza] you will now get a persistent notification added to your UI when this happens.

### <a class='title-link' name='asynchronous' href='#asynchronous'></a> Asynchronous 
This release contains the first asynchronous sensor and camera platforms. [@pvizeli] and [@fabaff] ported most of the "internal" sensors to async programming. We hope that you will enjoy the new speed. 

[@balloob] and [@pvizeli] worked a lot on the improvement of the core itself.

### <a class='title-link' name='weather-component' href='#weather-component'></a> Weather component 

For a long time we have had a bunch of [weather sensors][weather-sensors] but it's getting better: There is now a [Weather component][weather-component]. Sorry, not much more to tell right now. The plans are to create a weather UI element and to improve the initial implementation.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Hello again friend,

How are you? Having a good day? We sure are. If you aren't having a good day, this might cheer you up...

Every other weekend around here gets a little hectic leading to a big sigh of relief as we release a new version of Home Assistant to the world. And this time is no different. Our developer community has once again built us a beautiful new release with lots of new features and improvements. We hope you like it.

One last thing before we get going though, I should warn you... [@balloob] got a bit lazy this week and let me ([@robbiet480]) step up to the plate again to write the blog post and do the release. I guess I didn't do such a bad job in [0.27][zero-two-seven-release]. You'll never know what surprises I have in store. Now that i've got all that stuff out of the way, let's get started...

## <a class='title-link' name='stats-update' href='#stats-update'></a> Stats Update 
Sadly, no big amazing stats to update you with this time, but we did recently pass 7,000 commits! This release featured submissions from 45 contributors. Hopefully with the new updater component we will be able to give you some really good stats in the 0.32 blog post.

## <a class='title-link' name='hacktoberfest' href='#hacktoberfest'></a> Hacktoberfest 

![Hacktoberfest logo][logo]

October means Hacktoberfest time and our community has really come through with some excellent improvements and additions. As of this writing, we have 194 merged and 41 open pull requests to the [home-assistant repository][hacktoberfest-ha-prs] and 209 merged/28 open pull requests submitted to the [home-assistant.github.io repository][hacktoberfest-site-prs]. If you want to get in on the fun check out our [Hacktoberfest][hacktoberfest-blog] blog post or the [Hacktoberfest website][hacktoberfest-website]. You get an awesome t-shirt for free if you have 4 pull requests merged in the month of October! We even have tasks that a non-developer can easily accomplish with a tiny bit of work. Better hurry up though, only 9 days left and most of the easy tasks are gone!

## <a class='title-link' name='-a-greatly-improved-updater-component-please-read-this-' href='#-a-greatly-improved-updater-component-please-read-this-'></a> ‚ö†Ô∏è A greatly improved updater component (Please read this!) ‚ö†Ô∏è 

This release includes an update to our [updater] component. The responsibility of the updater component is to check if a new version is available and notify the user if this is the case.

It used to be that this component would check with [PyPi] (the Python package manager) to see if a new update was available. This had a couple of problems:

 1. We are unable to do a slow rollout
 2. We are unable to show the user extra information (like a link to a changelog or the release date)
 3. We are unable to warn users for critical security updates

So to work around these problems, we decided to start hosting the version check service ourselves. Since we had to get some infrastructure spun up anyway, we figured we would take it a step further. Which leads me to this bit of the update (the most important part):

### <a class='title-link' name='what-you-need-to-know-the-important-bit' href='#what-you-need-to-know-the-important-bit'></a> What you need to know (the important bit!) 

Remember how I mentioned that up there in the title that there is some serious business in this release? Well, we also added some basic analytics to the updater component which get sent to the server and stored so that we get a better idea of our user base.

Each Home Assistant instance running the updater component will generate a [unique ID][UUID] (based on UUIDv4) that will be used for the updater to be able to differentiate between instances. This UUID will be stored in your config directory in a file called `.uuid`.

#### Opting out

There are two ways to opt-out. The first way is by using the new `opt_out` option for the updater. This way the updater will continue to check for updates, but no information about your system will be shared with us.

```yaml
updater:
  reporting: no
```

You can also disable the updater component entirely by removing `updater:` from your `configuration.yaml` although **we would not suggest you do this** as you would miss any critical updates.

Finally, you can also reset your unique identifier by deleting the `.uuid` file and restarting Home Assistant.

#### Data stored on the Home Assistant update server

Here is what my production Home Assistant instance looks like from the server side:

| Name                  | Description                                | Example                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `arch`                | CPU Architecture                           | `x86_64`                           |
| `distribution`        | Linux Distribution name (only Linux)       | `Ubuntu`                           |

In addition to the above collected data, the server will also use your IP address to do a geographic IP address lookup to determine the city that you are from. To be extremely, extremely clear about this bit: __The Home Assistant updater does not: store your IP address in a database and also does not submit the location information from your `configuration.yaml`.__

  Geo-lookup on my IP resolves to Oakland with latitude/longitude pointing at the geographical center of the city.
</p>

The server also adds two timestamps to the data: the original date your instance UUID was first seen and the timestamp of the last time we have seen your instance. This gives us the following extra data:

| Name                  | Description                                | Example                            |

This data is held in the highest security. The update system runs in a secured Amazon Web Services account owned by me ([@robbiet480]). I personally have 5 years of experience with complex AWS deployments and have an extensive security background. I have audited the entire system and made sure to take every step to protect the data, including limiting who has access (just [@balloob] and myself). While not directly personally identifiable we absolutely understand some users hesistance to giving this information out. Please understand that we are only collecting this information to better understand our user base to provide better long term support and feature development then is currently possible.

We currently have no plans to publicly expose any of this information. If we did do such a thing in the future we would of course notify you in advance. It must also be stated that we will never sell or allow the use of this information for non-Home Assistant purposes.

We thank you for understanding why we are collecting this data and hope that you leave the feature enabled but fully understand if you feel uncomfortable with this.

_This section was updated on October 24 to be more clear about geo-lookups being on the city level. [See original version.][blog-orig]_

Now, back to the fun stuff...

## <a class='title-link' name='good-evening-im-ron-burgundy-and-heres-what-happening-in-your-world-tonight' href='#good-evening-im-ron-burgundy-and-heres-what-happening-in-your-world-tonight'></a> Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy and here's what happening in your world tonight. 

Home Assistant got a crazy idea recently that it couldn't do enough already and wanted to challenge itself even more. I really don't understand how it came up with this kooky idea, but it now thinks that its newest hobby should be a minor career in journalism.

0.31 adds support for the brand spanking new [Alexa Flash Briefing API](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/flash-briefing), allowing you to get updates from Home Assistant anytime you ask Alexa to read your flash briefing. What's the use case you ask? Well, now when I wake up in the morning and get my flash briefing, Home Assistant adds this to the end of it for me:

> Drive time with traffic is 35 minutes. There is an UberPOOL that will cost $11.52, estimated to be 2 minutes away, for a total of 37 minutes. BART is currently estimated to take 29 minutes. You should take BART, as it is estimated to be faster by 8 minutes.

Now I know how to best get to [my real job][runway] (no, Home Assistant is _not_ my real job, it does seem like it sometimes though) every morning. Obviously not the best home automation example, but I think you get the idea. I could see this being used to tell you any major events that happened in your home overnight or reading you your hyperlocal weather report. Thanks to the audio support you could even replace all of the default Alexa Flash Briefing sources with your own news feeds. Home Assistant supports both text and audio content as well as displaying data in the Alexa app. I also want to point out that unlike the existing Skill integration, the Flash Briefing API does _not_ require HTTPS (_but you should still be using HTTPS if possible_). For more information, check out the new [docs][flash-briefing-docs].

## <a class='title-link' name='major-breaking-z-wave-changes-ahead' href='#major-breaking-z-wave-changes-ahead'></a> Major breaking Z-Wave changes ahead 

A rather nasty Z-Wave [issue][z-wave-issue] was discovered recently by [@lukas-hetzenecker]. There was a somewhat large chance that if you had multiple of the same model Z-Wave device they may both try to use the same entity IDs. To fix the issue the internal Z-Wave index is now appended to the end of all Z-Wave entity IDs.

What this means for all you Z-Wave users is that you will need to update your configurations to reflect the change. I personally have quite a few (17) Z-Wave devices and went through the process this week. Here's what I had to do:

- Update customizations
- Update groups
- Update my `zwave.customize` section
- Update my Alexa skills that used old entity IDs
- Because I use `emulated_hue` with Alexa and `emulated_hue` uses the entity ID as a unique identifier I also had to remove all Z-Wave devices from Alexa and re-add them.

Your todo list may be a little different from mine, I just wanted to outline the steps I took to give you an idea of what you need to think about. It's not a very hard process, especially when using global find and replace in Sublime Text but did take me about 20 minutes to complete.

This is super annoying, I know, especially since we had said in [0.12][zero-one-two-release] that Z-Wave IDs should hopefully never change again, but we are now forced to eat those words. I will state again that Z-Wave IDs shouldn't change in the future but obviously we see how that went. To sum up on this section... sorry but it had to happen.

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/10/08/hassbian-rest-digital-ocean/"/>
    <updated>2016-10-08T03:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/10/08/hassbian-rest-digital-ocean</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, after only nine days comes 0.30. Don't worry, we will try to keep our usual release cycle and not start to release every day.

We guess that you already know: The [Raspberry Pi image][pi-image] is available now. For Hassbian, [@Landrash] has combined the most essential parts for a Home Assistant setup in an easy-to-use image for the Raspberry Pi device family. Hassbian is quite young, thus we are looking forward to recieve [feedback][hassbian-forum], [issue report][hassbian-forum], and [suggestions][hassbian-forum] to improve it. 

A large amount of resources of the development are still focusing on the effort to move Home Assistant further to asynchronous programming. It's a labor-intensive task, comes with segmentation faults, and unstable instances when certain combinations of sensors are used. The benefit will be more speed in the near future.

To reduce the run-time of your tests, [@balloob] did a lot of tweaking. For now the RFXtrx tests are excluded which cut the needed time for running on your Pull Request in half. 

### <a class='title-link' name='documentation' href='#documentation'></a> Documentation 

All configuration sample entries are now minimized. This should help to avoid problem for starters and newbies as they only get what's needed and not a full sample with all optional entries. If there is an issue with an entry in your `configuration.yaml` file the error message will provide you an URL that point to the documentation.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/screenshots/config-validation-url.png' />
</p>

As soon as the [Hacktoberfest] started there were a lot of incoming Pull Requests for the documentation. A huge "Thank you" to all participants. Especially, we would like to give a cookie to [@hillaryfraley]. She created around a dozen Pull Requests so far and didn't only fix typos but complete sections. The [Hacktoberfest] is still on-going and we are looking forward to get more Pull Requests.

### <a class='title-link' name='statistics' href='#statistics'></a> Statistics 

With the [statistics sensor][stats-sensor] we would like to introduce a new sensor that is similar to the [template sensor][template-sensor] or the [trend sensor][trend-sensor]. This sensor is consuming values from another sensor and is doing some statistical analysis of the data. Over a group of samples is the average/mean, the min/max, the total, the standard deviation, and the variance calculated which can be used in your automation rules. If the source is a binary sensor then the state changes are counted.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/screenshots/stats-sensor.png' />
</p>

As the results are processed on-the-fly you still need to use the data from your database for a in-depth analysis of your stored information. Check the latest [notebook] for doing statistics with your Home Assistant database.

### <a class='title-link' name='rest-we-dont' href='#rest-we-dont'></a> REST! We don't... 

There was a lot of work done on our implementation which are working with RESTful APIs. [@w1ll1am23] extended the [aREST] platforms to display if an aREST unit is available or not. The aREST implementations are now covered by the configuration check as well. Please check the Breaking changes section for more details.

The [REST sensor][rest-sensor] supports now HTTP authentication (basic and digest) and custom headers. This will allow you to access resources which are protected. This sample sensor will access GitHub and retrieve the latest release number while by-passing the rate limit for non-authenticated requests.

```yaml
sensor
  - platform: rest
    resource: https://api.github.com/repos/home-assistant/home-assistant/releases/latest
    username: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
    authentication: basic
    value_template: '{{ value_json.tag_name }}'
    headers:
      Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json
      Content-Type: application/json
      User-Agent: Home Assistant REST sensor
```

### <a class='title-link' name='misc' href='#misc'></a> Misc 

- GitHub released with a recent update a review feature. This will give you more control over your comments while you review an open Pull Request.
- Thanks to [@robbiet480] we are now running [mention-bot]. It will help you when you create a new Pull Request to identify potential reviewers.
- The [Home Assistant Community Forum][forum] has now an additional section called "Installation".

    <updated>2016-09-29T03:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/09/29/async-sleepiq-emoncms-stocks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Two weeks ago, September 17 marked our 3 year anniversary. In this time Home Assistant managed to grow from a simple script that turned on my lights when the sun set to a kick ass open source project with the best community an open-source project could wish for. This release contains features, bug fixes and performance tweaks by a total of **50** different people! We have also managed to cross the 1000 forks on GitHub. Talking about momentum!

This is a big release as we've completely overhauled the internals of Home Assistant. When I initially wrote Home Assistant, still figuring out the ins and outs of Python, I went for an approach that I was familiar with for an application with many moving parts: threads and locks. This approach has served us well over the years but it was slower than it needed to be, especially on limited hardware.

This all changed when [@bbangert] came around and took on the tough job to migrate the core over to use asynchronous programming. He did an amazing job and I am happy to say that the initial port has been done and is included in this release! On top of that, we have been able to keep our simple and straightforward API at the same time. We are still in the process of migrating more and more components over to the asynchronous API, so expect more speedups and awesome features in the upcoming releases.

### <a class='title-link' name='sleepiq-and-openalpr' href='#sleepiq-and-openalpr'></a> SleepIQ and OpenALPR 

There now is support for two new super cool things: Beds and license plates. [@technicalpickles] created a [SleepIQ] component that let you monitor the sensor data of your bed. [@pvizeli] has added license plate recognition based on [OpenALPR]! This means that you can now be notified about which car is parked on your driveway or in your garage. I also would like to use this opportunity to give a big shoutout to [@pvizeli] for being such an awesome member of our community. He joined us at the end of June and has helped crush bugs and add awesome features ever since (65 pull requests already!).

### <a class='title-link' name='configuration-validation' href='#configuration-validation'></a> Configuration validation 

On the voluptuous front we have also made great progress. We were able to fully remove the legacy config helpers and have migrated 323 of the 346 components and platforms that needed migrating! This does mean that for some components the configuration has slightly changed, make sure to check out the breaking changes section at the bottom for more info. Thanks everybody for reviewing the Pull requests, testing the changes, and reporting issues.

### <a class='title-link' name='delayed-release' href='#delayed-release'></a> Delayed Release 

As you might have noticed, this release has been delayed by 5 days. This was due to a rare, difficult to reproduce problem with the Python interpreter. A huuuuge thanks to all the people that have helped countless hours in researching, debugging and fixing this issue: [@bbangert], [@turbokongen], [@lwis], [@kellerza], [@technicalpickles], [@pvizeli], [@persandstrom] and [@joyrider3774]. I am grateful to have all of you as part of the Home Assistant community.

### <a class='title-link' name='hide-automation-rules' href='#hide-automation-rules'></a> Hide automation rules 

Since 0.28 [automation rules](/blog/2016/09/10/notify-group-reload-api-pihole/#reload-automation-rules) can be reloaded directly from the frontend. By default all automation rules are shown. If you want to [hide an automation rule](/getting-started/automation-create-first/), use `hide_entity: True`.
