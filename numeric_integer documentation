The `numeric_integer` component allows the user to store and update values that can be controlled within conditions of automation. Changes the values generate state events. These state events can be utilized as `automation` triggers as well. 

To enable this numeric_integer in your installation, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
numeric_integer:
  days_value:
    name: Days Value
	icon: mdi:calendar-today
```

{% configuration %}
  numeric_integer:
    description: Alias for the input. Multiple entries are allowed.
    required: true
    type: map
    keys:
      name:
        description: Friendly name of the input.
        required: false
        type: string
      initial:
        description: Initial value when Home Assistant starts.
        required: false
        type: integer
        default: none
      unit_of_measurement:
        description: Unit of measurement in which the value of the slider is expressed in.
        required: false
        type: string
      icon:
        description: Icon to display in front of value in the frontend. Refer to the [Customizing devices](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/#possible-values) page for possible values.
        required: false
        type: icon
{% endconfiguration %}

### {% linkable_title Restore State %}

This component will automatically restore the state it had prior to Home Assistant stopping as long as you have the `recorder` component enabled and your entity does **not** have a set value for `initial`. To disable this feature, set a valid value for `initial`. Additional information can be found in the [Restore state](/components/recorder/#restore-state) section of the [`recorder`](/components/recorder/) component documentation.

## {% linkable_title Automation Examples %}

Here's an example of `numeric_float` being used as a trigger in an automation.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry using 'time as a trigger in an automation to add one day to 'numeric_integer' value
automation:
  - trigger:
  - at: 00:00:00
    platform: time
  action:
  - service: numeric_integer.set_value
    data_template:
      entity_id: numeric_integer.days_value
      value: '{{states.numeric_integer.days_value.state | int + 1}}'
  alias: Add Day
  id: add_day
```
{% endraw %}
