### To install the software on your ESP32-S3-BOX

Before you can use this device with Home Assistant, you need to install a bit of software on it.

1. While keeping this tutorial page open, open the [ESPHome projects page](https://esphome.io/projects/index.html) in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop. It does not work on a tablet or phone.
   - In the **I want to create a** section, select **Voice assistant**.
   - Select the image of the ESP32-S3-BOX.
   - From the list, select the product variant that you have.
   - Select the **Connect** button. If your browser does not support web serial, you will see a warning instead of a button.
   - **For advanced users**: The configuration files are available on GitHub:
     - [ESP32-S3-BOX](https://github.com/esphome/firmware/blob/main/voice-assistant/esp32-s3-box.yaml)
     - [ESP32-S3-BOX-3](https://github.com/esphome/firmware/blob/main/voice-assistant/esp32-s3-box-3.yaml)
     - [ESP32-S3-BOX-Lite](https://github.com/esphome/firmware/blob/main/voice-assistant/esp32-s3-box-lite.yaml)

{% include voice_assistant/install_esp_firmware.md %}

1.  Select the **ESPHome** integration. Under **Devices**, you should see the **ESP32-S3-BOX** listed.

   - Your ESP32-S3-BOX is connected to Home Assistant over Wi-Fi. You can now move it to any place in your home with a USB power supply.
2.   Congratulations! You can now voice control Home Assistant via a ESP32 device with a display. Now give some commands.

## Controlling Home Assistant over the ESP32-S3-BOX

1. Say your wake word. For this tutorial, use "OK, Nabu".
2. Say a [supported voice command](/voice_control/builtin_sentences/). For example, *Turn on the light*.
   - Once the intent has been processed, the LED lights up in green and Home Assistant confirms the action.
      - Make sure youâ€™re using the area name exactly as you defined it in Home Assistant.
      - You can also ask a question, such as
          - *Is the front door locked?*
          - *Which lights are on in the living room?*
3. Your command is not supported? Add your own commands using [a sentence trigger](/voice_control/custom_sentences/).

## Turning off microphone or screen

1. If you do not want to use a wake word for a while, you can turn off the microphone.
   - Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %} and select the **ESPHome** integration.
      - Under **ESP32-S3-BOX**, select **1 device**.
      - Disable **Use wake word**.
      - The screen of the ESP32-S3-BOX will turn off, too.

     - Under **ESP32-S3-BOX**, select **1 device**.
