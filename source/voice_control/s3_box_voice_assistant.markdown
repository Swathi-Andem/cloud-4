## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant 2023.12, installed with the Home Assistant Operating System
- [Home Assistant Cloud](/voice_control/voice_remote_cloud_assistant/) or a manually configured [Assist Pipeline](/voice_control/voice_remote_local_assistant)
- Have [enabled a wake word](/voice_control/install_wake_word_add_on/) for your voice assistant
- The password to your 2.4&nbsp;GHz Wi-Fi network
- Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop (not Android/iOS)
- One of the three Espressif ESP32-S3-BOX variants:
  - [ESP32-S3-BOX-3](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/1005005920207976.html?gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt)
  - ESP32-S3-BOX or ESP32-S3-BOX-Lite (not currently on the market)
- USB-C cable to connect the ESP32-S3-BOX-3

## Installing the software onto the ESP32-S3-BOX-3

Before you can use this device with Home Assistant, you need to install a bit of software on it.

1. Make sure this page is opened in a Chromium-based browser on a desktop. It does not work on a tablet or phone.

   - If you have an ESP32-S3-BOX-3, select the **Connect** button below. If your browser does not support web serial, you will see a warning instead of a button.
     - If your device does not readily connect for flashing, you may need to put your ESP32-S3-BOX-3 into "flash mode" by holding the "boot" button (left side upper button), tapping the "reset" button (left side lower button), and then releasing them both. Wait a few seconds before attempting to connect.


      <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/esp-web-tools@9/dist/web/install-button.js?module"></script>
      <esp-web-install-button manifest="https://firmware.esphome.io/voice-assistant/esp32-s3-box-3/manifest.json"></esp-web-install-button>


   - If you have an ESP32-S3-BOX or ESP32-S3-BOX-Lite, open the [ESPHome projects](https://esphome.io/projects/index.html?type=voice) page, select your variant and follow the installation instructions.
   - **For advanced users**: The configuration files are available on GitHub:
     - [ESP32-S3-BOX-3](https://github.com/esphome/firmware/blob/main/voice-assistant/esp32-s3-box-3.yaml)

{% include voice_assistant/install_esp_firmware.md %}

9. Select the **ESPHome** integration. Under **Devices**, you should see the **ESP32-S3-BOX-3** listed.

   - Your ESP32-S3-BOX-3 is connected to Home Assistant over Wi-Fi. You can now move it to any place in your home with a USB power supply.

10. Congratulations! You can now voice control Home Assistant via a ESP32 device with a display. Now give some commands.

## Controlling Home Assistant

1. Say your wake word. For this tutorial, use "OK, Nabu".
2. Say a [supported voice command](/voice_control/builtin_sentences/). For example, *Turn on the light*.
   - Once the intent has been processed, the LED lights up in green and Home Assistant confirms the action.
      - Make sure youâ€™re using the area name exactly as you defined it in Home Assistant.
      - You can also ask a question, such as
          - *Is the front door locked?*
          - *Which lights are on in the living room?*
3. Your command is not supported? Add your own commands using [a sentence trigger](/voice_control/custom_sentences/).

## Turning off microphone or screen

1. If you do not want to Assist to listen for a while, you can turn off the microphone.
   - Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %} and select the **ESPHome** integration.
      - Under **ESP32-S3-BOX-3**, select **1 device**.
      - Enable **Mute**.
      - The screen of the ESP32-S3-BOX-3 will turn off, too.

2. If you want to just use the wake word, but do not want to use the screen, you can turn it off.
   - Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %} and select the **ESPHome** integration.
     - Under **ESP32-S3-BOX-3**, select **1 device**.
     - Disable **LCD Backlight**.
