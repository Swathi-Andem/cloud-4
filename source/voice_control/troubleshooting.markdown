## If the phrase did not work, even without voice

1. Try a variant. For example, if *Turn off the light* doesn't work, try: *Turn off the lights in the kitchen*.
1. Check if the phrase is [supported](/voice_control/builtin_sentences/).
1. Check if the devices are exposed to Assist.
   * Under {% my voice_assistants title="**Settings** > **Voice assistants**" %}, open the **Expose** tab.
   * If you do not see the device in the list, select **Expose entities** and add the device.
1. If the phrase includes an area, make sure the device is added to that area.
   * Under **{% my integrations title="Settings > Devices & Services" %}**, on the integration, select devices.
   * From the list of devices, select the device of interest.
   * In the top right corner, select the pencil item.
   * Add the device to that area.
1. Make sure you are using the name of the area exactly as it is defined in Home Assistant.

## If the phrase worked with Assist, but not with voice

1. [Open the debug view](#view-debug-information).
1. If you see that speech-to-text failed:
   - Go back to your voice assistant.
   - Under **Speech-to-text**, check if there are multiple variants supported for your language.
   - Try out different language variants. It could be that recognition works better with one of the variants.


## I do not see any assistant

If under {% my voice_assistants title="**Settings** > **Voice assistants**" %} you do not see any assistants, you are not using the default configuration. The image below shows the **Assist** section.

If the **Assist** section is missing entirely, you need to add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   # Example configuration.yaml entry
   assist_pipeline:
   ```
