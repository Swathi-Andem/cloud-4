Assist is our feature to allow you to control Home Assistant using natural language. It is built on top of an open voice foundation and powered by knowledge provided by our community.

## Supported platforms

Assist is available to use on most platforms that can interface with Home Assistant. Look for the Assist icon <img src='/images/assist/assist-icon.svg' alt='Assist icon' style='height: 32px' class='no-shadow'>:

### Phone

The easiest way to get started with Assist is probably by using it on your phone.

- Inside the Home Assistant app in the top-right corner, select the Assist icon.
- On Apple devices via [Siri and Assist shortcuts](/voice_control/apple).
- On Android phones as the default [digital assistant or home screen shortcut](/voice_control/android).
- On a tablet in kiosk mode, you can use a [dashboard button](/voice_control/start_assist_from_dashboard/) to start Assist.

### Watch

Assist is also available on watches:

- On Wear OS watches as the default digital assistant or using [Assist tile or complication](/voice_control/android/#assist-on-wear-os/).

### Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa

_Want to use Home Assistant with Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa? Get started with [Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.nabucasa.com/config/)._

### Analog phone

With the Voice over IP integration, you can even use an [analog phone](/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/) to talk to Assist.

### ESPHome

And of course you can use [ESPHome devices](/voice_control/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/), to create your own awesome Assistant device. Like @piitaya did with his 3D printed R5 droid.

## Wake words

You can [enable a wake word](/voice_control/install_wake_word_add_on) to activate Assist. There are predefined wake words, such as "OK Nabu", but you can also [define your own wake word](/voice_control/create_wake_word/)

## Create an assistant with an OpenAI personality

Want to talk to Super Mario? Or another figure? If you want Assist to respond in a fun way, you can create an assistant with an [OpenAI personality](/voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/).

## Supported languages and sentences

Assist already supports a wide range of [languages](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/supported-languages).

Use the [built-in sentences](/voice_control/builtin_sentences) to control entities and areas, or [create your own sentences](/voice_control/custom_sentences/).

Did Assist not understand your sentence? [Contribute them](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/).

_Assist was introduced in Home Assistant 2023.2._
