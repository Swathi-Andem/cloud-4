If you are using Hassbian, browse to [http://hassbian.local:8123](http://hassbian.local:8123) to open the Home Assistant frontend.

For a standard installation the command shown below starts Home Assistant and serves the frontend at [http://IP_ADDRESS:8123](http://IP_ADDRESS:8123).

```bash
$ hass
```

To see what Home Assistant can do, launch the demo mode: `hass --demo-mode`.
