Let's start by adding your first integration so that you can see and change a smart home device.

From the side bar, click on {% my integrations title="Settings -> Devices & Services" %}. At this screen you will be able to set up integrations with Home Assistant. You might notice a "discovered" section. This section contains integrations that were found on your network and can easily be added with a few clicks. If your integrations are not discovered, click the **Add integration** button in the lower right and search for your integration in that list.

When each integration is done setting up, it will ask you to put the new devices in areas. Areas allow you to organize all the devices in your home.

When you're done, navigate back to the web interface and voila, your devices are ready for you to control.
