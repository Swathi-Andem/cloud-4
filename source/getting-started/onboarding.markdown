Alright, you made it here. The tough part is done.

After entering the Home Assistant device's address in your browser's address bar, the preparation screen is shown. Depending on your hardware, preparation may take a while.

With Home Assistant installed, it's time to set up the basics.

In this step, you will create the owner account of Home Assistant. This account is an administrator account. It will always be able to change everything. 
 
1. Enter a name, username, and password.  Select **Create account**.

2. Enter a name for your home and define the location specific settings and the language of the user interface. 
   - To automatically populate these settings, select **Detect**.
   - If you'd rather not send your location, you can set these values manually.

3. Select which information you are willing to share.

4. Once you are done, select **Next**. 
    - Home Assistant will then show any {% term devices %} it has discovered on your network.
    - Don't be alarmed if you see fewer items than shown below; you can always manually add devices later.
