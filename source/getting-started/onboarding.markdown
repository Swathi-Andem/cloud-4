Alright, you made it here. The tough part is done. Just a few things left to configure.

With Home Assistant installed, it's time for doing the initial configuration. Here you will create the owner account of Home Assistant. This account will be an administrator and will always be able to change everything. Enter a name, username, password and click on "create account".

Next step you need to name your Home, the default is prefilled but you can name as you see fit.

Then select your location (you can hit the detect button to help), this is used to set your co-ordinates for items like weather, also make sure to set your timezone from the dropdown below. You should also set your elevation.

Validate your units, Metric or Imperial then select next.

In the next stage Home Assistant will discover all the awesome items you have in your house and ask you to configure them. Most items should be self explanatory and don't worry, if you miss something you can always add it in later.

For each integration, it will ask you to put the new devices in areas. Areas allow you to organize all the devices in your home.

Once you are happy select Finish.

Now you're brought to the main screen of Home Assistant this will show all your devices.
