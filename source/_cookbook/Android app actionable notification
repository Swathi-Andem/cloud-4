This example automation sends an actionable notification to your Android companion app, based on the binary workday sensor and time.

These first three lines go into configuration.yaml and generate the binary_sensor "workday"

```yaml

binary_sensor:
  - platform: workday
    country: US
  
```
This next portion Sends the notification to your device with action buttons, and goes in automations.yaml or can be created through the automations section in the UI.

```yaml

- alias: Turn on Coffee Pot - Weekend notification
  description: Fires an actionable notification at 5:45 via the mobile app to turn
    on the coffee pot
  ##For time, 05:45:00 is 5:45 AM. 5:45 PM would be written as 17:45:00
  trigger:
  - at: 05:45:00
    platform: time
  ##This condition tells HA not to send the notification unless it is a weekend or holiday.
  condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.workday_sensor
    state: 'off'
  ## You can send up to three actions in a notification, for this case we only need 1. 
  action:
  - data:
      data:
        actions:
        ## The action start_coffee will be the name of the fire_event that is handled in the next automation
        - action: start_coffee
          title: 'Yes'
      message: Good Morning!
      title: Would you like a cup of coffee?
    service: notify.mobile_app_**_***
```

Now we have to handle the Fire_event to actually turn on the coffee pot, so put this in automation.yaml as well.

```yaml

  - alias: Fire Event - start_coffee
    description: When start_coffee action is received from HA companion app, coffee maker turns on
    trigger:
    - event_data:
        action: start_coffee
      event_type: mobile_app_notification_action
      platform: event
    condition: []
    action:
    - data: {}
      entity_id: switch.coffee_pot
      service: switch.toggle
```
