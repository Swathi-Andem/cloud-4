If you're trying to run ozwcp, just create a service for it and run it 24/7! That way, you can just stop the zwave network inside of hass, open your browser to the ozwcp page, connect, do you thing, disconnect, and then start the zwave network back up in Home-Assistant
<code>sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ozwcp.service</code>

```
[Unit]
Description=OpenZWave Control Panel
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/open-zwave-control-panel
ExecStart=/root/open-zwave-control-panel/ozwcp
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
##For the AIO Raspberry installer the example would look like this:

```
[Unit]
Description=OpenZWave Control Panel
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/srv/hass/src/open-zwave-control-panel
ExecStart=/srv/hass/src/open-zwave-control-panel/ozwcp
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
<br>
<code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload </code> <br>
<code>sudo systemctl enable ozwcp.service </code><br>
<code>sudo systemctl start ozwcp.service </code><br>
And then you're good to use it whenever you want!<br>

To integrate the panel in Home Assistant just add a iframe in your configuration.yaml like this:

<br>
```
panel_iframe:
ozwcp:
  title: Open Z-wave Control Panel
  icon: 'mdi:access-point'
  url: 'http://192.168.1.22:8090/'
```

With the initd script the OZWCP will start on boot and will be available and should look like this:
<br>
![Alt text](https://files.gitter.im/home-assistant/home-assistant/KN7a/blob "OZWCP")

<br>
To be able to w√≥rk in the OZWCP you must stop the z-wave network e.g. in hass via service:
<br>
![Alt text](https://files.gitter.im/home-assistant/home-assistant/6D4K/blob "Stop z-wave network")
<br>
When you finished working in OWZCP hit "close" and you are done. Now you just want to start the z-wave network in Home-Assistant again.
