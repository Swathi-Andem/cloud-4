If you're trying to run ozwcp, why not just create a service for it and run it 24/7? That way, you can just stop the zwave network inside of hass, open your browser to the ozwcp page, connect, do you thing, disconnect, and then start the zwave network back up in hass?
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ozwcp.service
 [Unit]
Description=OpenZWave Control Panel
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/open-zwave-control-panel
ExecStart=/root/open-zwave-control-panel/ozwcp
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Make sure to update the directories to match your own.
Ctrl+X, Y, Enter
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable ozwcp.service
sudo systemctl start ozwcp.service
And then you're good to use it whenever you want!
