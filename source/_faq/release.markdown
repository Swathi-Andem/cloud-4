Home Assistant has **major**, **minor** and **patch** releases. Version numbers take the form of <major_version>.<minor_version>.<patch_version>.

**Major versions** are incremented very rarely, and signify significant changes or milestones in the development process. Home Assistant incremented from 0.x.x to 1.x.x in December 2020.

**Minor versions** are released approximately every three weeks. The exact dates can be seen in the upcoming events calendar on the [Home Assistant Developers](https://developers.home-assistant.io/) website. A minor version incorporates all of the new features, integrations, improvements etc that have been added over the two week period since the last release; they go through a week of beta testing, then are launched to the broader Home Assistant userbase.

**Patch versions** are released as needed in the weeks following a minor version. They don't include any new features or integrations; they cherry pick specific commits that address bugs, regressions or other high priority issues that can't wait for the next minor version.

### Accessing versions early

The third week of the release schedule is primarily focused on [beta testing](/docs/installation/updating/#run-the-beta-version). Users who participate in the beta can view the changelog under [beta release notes](https://rc.home-assistant.io/latest-release-notes/) and get help in the `#beta` channel of [Home Assistant's Discord server](/join-chat). Testers are also encouraged to [report issues on GitHub](/help/#bugs-feature-requests-and-alike).

If you want to access commits immediately, without waiting for a release, you can also [run dev](/docs/installation/updating/#run-the-development-version) - but be aware this introduces instability and substantial risk.
