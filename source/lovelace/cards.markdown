Cards provide a structure for interfacing with your Lovelace dashboard.

There are several built-in card types, each with their own configuration options. Select a card from the menu to view additional details and the options for that card.

To add a card to your user interface, click the Lovelace menu (three dots at the top right of the screen) and then **Edit Dashboard**. Click the **Add Card** button in the bottom right corner and select from the card picker.
