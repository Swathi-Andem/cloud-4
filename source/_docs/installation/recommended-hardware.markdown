Platform | Notes
-- | --
Raspberry Pi Zero/Pi 2 | **Only** use these for testing
Raspberry Pi 3/3+/4 | This is a good starting point, and depending on the amount of devices you integrate this can be enough - use an [A2 class SD](https://amzn.to/2X0Z2di) card if possible.
NUC i3 | This is if you need a little more power over a Pi
NUC i5 | This will allow you to run multiple services without any issues, perfect for a homelab
NUC i7/i9 | Pure power, you should not have *any* performance issues
