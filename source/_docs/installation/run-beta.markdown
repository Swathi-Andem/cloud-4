If you would like to test next release before anyone else, you can install the beta version released every three weeks:

1. Backup your installation, using the snapshot functionality Home Assistant offers.
2. Check the [Home Assistant Beta release notes](https://rc.home-assistant.io/latest-release-notes/) for breaking changes. Be sure to check all release notes between the version you are running and the one you are upgrading to. Use the search function in your browser (`CTRL + f`) and search for **Breaking Changes**.
3. Select _System_ tab from the _Supervisor_ menu, then select _Join Beta Channel_ under _Supervisor_, then select _Reload_.
4. Select _Dashboard_ tab from the _Supervisor_ menu, and then select _Update_.
