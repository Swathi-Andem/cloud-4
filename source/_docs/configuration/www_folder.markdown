If you wish to share or view files via the Home-Assistant front end this can be done by creating a folder `www` in the configuration directory. Files added to this folder can then be viewed in a browser by navigating to the appropriate url. For example, if you added the file image.jpg this would be viewable at `http://localhost:8123/local/image.jpg`.
