You can disable entities and automations and re-enable them again.

## Disabling or enabling elements

1. In Home Assistant, open the table of interest.
   - To disable or enable entities, go to {% my entities title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Entities**" %}.
   - To disable or enable automations, go to {% my automations title="**Settings** > **Automations & Scenes**" %}.
2. [Enable multiselect](/docs/organizing/filtering) and select all the entities you want to disable or enable.
3. In the top right corner, select the three dots menu, then select **Disable** or **Enable**.
