Home Assistant Core 2024.3! üéâ

Yes, you read the title right! I'm super stoked about this one. It has been
talked about for ages... I promise it is real:

**Drag 'n drop for dashboards is finally here! üéâ**

A first experimental version of the section dashboard that supports drag 'n drop.
A tremendous step forward and an even bigger milestone for Home Assistant!

But don't be blinded by these Dungeons 'n Dragons; there is a lot more!

New intents for Assist (I can finally tell my vacuum to start cleaning!), using
script inputs/fields from the dashboard, and a new energy graph for individual
devices. And that is just the tip of the iceberg!

Enjoy the release!

## A new experimental sections view

Our dashboard currently comes with three view layout types:
[Panel](/dashboards/panel/), [Sidebar](/dashboards/sidebar/),
and [Masonry](/dashboards/masonry/). Since the past year, we have been working
hard to research and ideate on how to make dashboards easier to customize
and use, and we learned that our current layouts are not the best for such
purposes. Drag-and-drop rearrangement of cards cannot work well with the
Masonry layout.

We came up with a few solutions, and the first thing we would like to share
with you is a new view layout type called "Sections".

Home Assistant dashboards are robust and packed with information. Users will
often place dozens of cards for all sorts of buttons, switches, graphs,
indicators, and more.

<p class='img'>
    <img width="66%" src="/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/sections-section-example.png" alt="Example of a dashboard section"/>
    Example of a dashboard section
</p>

By grouping cards into ‚Äúsections‚Äù, you can reduce the number of items you
need to scan through when you are looking for a certain card, as you'll be
able to look for the relevant group title first and then reduce the scope to
scan that particular group for the information.

By packing cards in a section into a grid with a fixed number of columns,
the relative positions of the cards within a section are not affected by
changes in screen sizes, and so the spatial memory of the cards is retained,
leading to a faster and less cumbersome experience.

<p class='img'>
    <img src="/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/sections-example-dashboard.png" alt="A fully populated dashboard in Sections view layout"/>
    A fully populated dashboard in the Sections view layout
</p>

Cards in the new sections view type are all aligned in a tidy grid to ensure
consistency and predictability of their positions when the screen size changes.
We currently have three cards reworked to fit the grid:
[Tile](/dashboards/tile/), [Sensor](/dashboards/sensor/),
and [Button](/dashboards/button/) cards. These cards will occupy the right
amount of space in the grid, while other cards will occupy the full width
of a section by default at the moment. Moreover, we have tweaked our
"Add Cards" dialogs to recommend Tile cards by default when the sections
view type is in use.

<div class='note warning'>
    The new Sections view is experimental! Please do not build your daily dashboard on top of it yet! We are releasing this early so that we can collect your feedback.
</div>

To get started with the new Sections view type, create a new view on your
dashboard and select **Sections (experimental)** as the view type.
We currently do not have the option to migrate your current dashboard over yet.

For more information, check out our blog post about our new
series [A Home-Approved Dashboard: Chapter 1](/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/).

Amazing work! Thanks [Paul](https://github.com/piitaya),

and [Madelena](https://github.com/madelena)!

## Drag-and-drop rearrangement of cards and sections!

Wow! At long last!! The stars have aligned, and our experimental drag-and-drop
feature for dashboards is finally here! ü•≤

With the new sections view type, we can finally implement a way to arrange
cards and sections that is intuitive with drag-and-drop gestures and predictable
with how the cards will rearrange while creating a dashboard that is easy to
navigate and remember. You will no longer need to pray and guess where the cards
will land when they change their order!

### How to drag and drop <!-- omit from toc -->

While your dashboard is in edit mode:

    Rearranging sections with drag-and-drop
</p>

- To rearrange sections, tap and hold the
  <img height="28px" src="/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/mdi-edit.png" alt="Edit icon"/>
  **Move** handle and then move your cursor or finger towards your desired
  location. Other sections will move out of the way for where the selected
  section will drop.

- To rearrange cards, tap and hold anywhere on the card and then move your
  cursor or finger towards your desired location.

Don‚Äôt you love it when instructions are so short? Simplicity FTW! ü¶Ñ

## Running script from your dashboard with user input

{% term Scripts %} in Home Assistant allow you to capture a sequence of actions
and choices in a reusable way. Scripts are extra powerful because they can
have input fields, allowing you to send in data for when the script runs.

Script fields can be defined in the script editor and show up when you call the
script in your automation. In this release, script fields will be available
in the more info dialog when tapping a script on a dashboard.

This allows you to provide the input fields and run the script, unlocking a
whole new dimension of possibilities.

<lite-youtube videoid="Ulkl1L8F1L4" videotitle="Calling scripts from the dashboard"></lite-youtube>

To accompany this new functionality, we‚Äôve created two blueprints to help you
get started with using scripts on your dashboard:

**Announce message**: This blueprint allows you to create an announce script for
your dashboard pre-configured to a specific media player and text-to-speech
engine. When activated, it will ask the user for the message to play.

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/announce-text-to-speech-on-media-player/699186" %}

**Add to to-do list**: This blueprint allows you to create a script to add an
item to a to-do list pre-configured to a specific to-do list. When activated,
it will ask the user for the item to add.

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/add-to-do-item/699193" %}

## New energy graph for individual devices

Digging into your energy data is a very interesting way to find ways to reduce
your household's energy usage and environmental footprint. üå±

One of the missing bricks was the ability to see the energy consumption
of individual devices over time. Thanks to [@karwosts], we have a
brand new graph on the energy dashboard that provides this insight!

Using this new graph, you can now easily spot which devices are responsible
for which part of your energy usage over time.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-03/individual-devices-usage.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new energy stacked bar graph of individual devices over time.'>

For example, in the above picture, it is very easy to see that the dishwasher
was responsible for the morning spike and the oven for the spike in the evening.

## New sentences for Assist

[Assist](/voice_control/), our private voice assistant, learned a few tricks this month.

Support for valves has been added. You can now ask Assist to adjust the position
of a valve, or just open or close a valve completely.

Also, cover support has been extended to support the control of the position of
your devices. Currently, most languages only support a single use-case as a
starting point. Setting the position of a single device by targeting its
name:

> Set the curtain position to 80%

We are working on extending the use-case coverage to set the position
of multiple devices or complete areas, similar to what is possible with
the open and close sentences.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-03/new-assist-commands.png' alt='Screenshot showing a few of the new Assist commands.'>

The next new trick could be considered a bug fix: Until today it was not
possible to start or stop a vacuum cleaner by voice; Now it can! Assist knows
how to start a vacuum and return it to its base. Here are some example
sentences, in case you have a vacuum cleaner named Dusty:

> Start Dusty

> Return Dusty to base

The biggest set of changes is for media players. Assist can now pause playback,
resume playback, skip to the next media, and set the volume of media players!

Be aware that currently, these sentences are limited to targeting a single
device by its name, for example:

> Skip to the next song on the TV

We are actively working on extending the logic of these new intents to allow
you to target areas and only affect the desired media player(s).

## Disabling the remote activation of the Home Assistant Remote UI

If you are using [Home Assistant Cloud](https://nabucasa.com), you can access
your Home Assistant instance remotely using the Remote UI feature.

Suppose this feature is, for some reason, disabled, and you are currently not
at home. In that case, you can enable the Remote UI feature remotely by
logging into your [Nabu Casa account](https://account.nabucasa.com/) and
request your Home Assistant instance to turn it on.

Feedback from the community has shown that this feature is not always desired,
and this release adds a new option to disable the remote activation of the
Remote UI feature. Once disabled, the Remote UI feature can only be enabled
locally from your Home Assistant instance.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-03/home-assistant-cloud-disable-remove-activation.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new advanced option that allows disabling remote activation of the Home Assistant remote UI.'>

## Translating states in your templates

Are you using {% term templates %} to send notifications in automations? If so,
[@PiotrMachowski] might just have added something new you need!

A new template method, `state_translated`, to translate entity states directly
from your templates! Consider this template example:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Untranslated
{{ states("binary_sensor.movement_backyard") }}  # Shows: on
{{ states("sun.sun") }}  # Shows: below_horizon
```
{% endraw %}

The above example shows the raw state of two entities. However, with the
new `state_translated` method, you can get the state in a human-readable form:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Translated
{{ state_translated("binary_sensor.movement_backyard") }}  # Shows: Detected
{{ state_translated("sun.sun") }}  # Shows: Below horizon
```
{% endraw %}

Even better, it uses the default language of your Home Assistant instance. So,
if you use Home Assistant in a different language, the translated state will
be in that language.

## Home Assistant boots twice as fast

In case you didn't know, every release [@bdraco] improves the performance
on some aspect of Home Assistant. He has been on it for a long time and keeps
pushing to improve it.

As a matter of fact, it has become so regular that we don't always highlight
his enormous efforts toward this goal in our release notes. _Sorry! üôè_

However, in this release, his efforts are so noticeable that we wanted to
call it out: **Home Assistant now boots on average twice as fast!** üöÄ

That is a huge improvement [@bdraco]!! Thank you for your continuous work on
making Home Assistant faster and faster! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "AEMET" %}

The daily data for the current day wasn't available after midday, and
now it will be. Automations and scripts relying on `day[0]` for checking
the next-day forecast will have to be adjusted to use `day[1]` instead.

[@Noltari]: https://github.com/Noltari
[#107795]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/107795

{% enddetails %}

{% details "JuiceNet" %}

The JuiceNet integration has been removed.

Enel X has migrated from JuiceNet to JuicePass, rendering the JuiceNet
integration useless. Background and alternative solutions to the juicenet
integration can be found in the related
[issue](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/86588).

([@emontnemery] - [#111477])

[#111477]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/111477

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Met.no" %}

The met.no integration previously created two entities for each configured
location: one provided daily weather forecasts,
and one provided hourly forecasts.

The met.no integration now only creates a single entity that provides
both daily and hourly weather forecasts.

{% details "MQTT" %}

Aux heat, deprecated in Home Assistant Core 2023.9, is now removed from
the MQTT climate.

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#109513]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/109513

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

For Z-Wave `climate` entities, the behavior of the `climate.turn_on` service
has changed. Previously, the service would act in the following order depending
on whether the corresponding conditions were met:

1. If the entity supported the `off` mode and exactly one additional mode,
   `climate.turn_on` would set the mode to the additional mode.
2. If conditions for 1 were not met and at least one of the following modes were
   available, the service would set the mode to the first mode it found
   in the specified order: `heat_cool`, `heat`, `cool`.
3. If conditions for 1 and 2 were not met, the service would silently do nothing.

Now, the service follows the following behavior in order:

1. If the entity supports the `resume` thermostat mode, it will be used to
   restore the last mode you used before the entity was turned off.
2. If the condition for 1 isn't met and the entity was turned off in
   Home Assistant, and Home Assistant wasn't restarted, Home Assistant
   remembers the last "on" mode and will set it to that mode. Home Assistant
   will be unable to set the entity to the previous mode if Home Assistant
   starts with the entity already in `off` mode since the integration will
   not know what the previous mode was.
3. If conditions for 1 and 2 are not met and at least one of the following
   modes is available, the service sets the mode to the first mode it finds
   in the specified order: `heat_cool`, `heat`, `cool`
   (no change to condition 2 above).
4. If conditions for 1, 2, and 3 are not met, the mode will be set to the first
   supported mode it finds (like `dry` or `fan_only`).
