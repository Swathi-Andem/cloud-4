## Climate, humidifier and water heater more info

The more info for climate, humidifier and water heater entities got an update, if you ask me, they look absolutely stunning!
They now have a newly designed circular slider, that shows the current temperature and the setpoint(s).
There are also buttons to change the setpoint.
It will glow in the middle to show it's current action, as well as show that.

## Lawn mower

A new entity component was added this release, the lawn mower!

You can now integrate your lawn mower in Home Assistant! 
For now just MQTT is supported, but keep an eye out for other integrations!

## Group previews

When setting up a helper, sometimes it can be useful to see how the entity that you are creating looks while you are setting it up. That's why we added a preview when you create or change a group helper.

It will show exactly what the entity will look like with the current settings.

And talking about groups, we also got a new group, the `event` group!

Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>


## Template sensors from the UI

We also added preview support to another helper, that finally made it's way into the UI, the template sensor. 

From the UI you can use a template to set the state of the sensor.
You can pick a unit of measurement, set the device class and select a state class.
Both sensors and binary sensors are supported.

This will make most of the use cases for template sensors available through the UI and one less need for YAML!

Other more advanced fields, like attributes, are not available from the UI. You will still have to set those up in YAML.

With the preview, you see a live update of the sensors value while you are writing the template.

Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>


## Weather forecast service

We added a weather forecast service, that returns the weather forecast.

Previously you would have to look at the `forecast` attribute of a weather entity to get the forecast, now this can be done by calling a new service, `weather.get_forecast`, that will respond with the forecast.
You can also specify what type of forecast you want, daily or do you want to know it for every hour? This means you no longer need separate entities for every forecast type, but it can all be done in 1 entity.

In the weather card in your dashboard, you can also now pick what kind of weather forecast you want to show in that card.

All weather integrations are updated to support this new service.

With this change, the `forecast` attribute of the weather entity is deprecated, and will be removed in Home Assistant Core 2024.3.

Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

## Onboarding

Our onboarding got a fresh new look and it is now easier to get started with Home Assistant!

Something you probably have not seen for a while, but we gave our onboarding a fresh new look! It is shortened to get the user in Home Assistant as fast as possible.

## Breaking changes

**Note**: Breaking changes processed up to PR 98609

{% details "BMW Connected Drive" %}

The "Refresh from cloud" button has been removed. Use the
`homeassistant.update_entity` service with any BMW entity for a
full reload instead.

([@rikroe] - [#97864]) ([documentation](/integrations/bmw_connected_drive))

[@rikroe]: https://github.com/rikroe
[#97864]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97864

{% enddetails %}

{% details "DoorBird" %}

The `doorbird_reset_favorites` event is no longer fired when the clear webhook
is called. Note: this event was never documented.

([@bdraco] - [#98585]) ([documentation](/integrations/doorbird))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#98585]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98585

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Enphase Envoy" %}

Envoy versions < 3.9 (pre-API) are no longer supported as they require
web scraping which is disallowed by [ADR-0004](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/blob/master/adr/0004-webscraping.md).

([@bdraco] - [#97862]) ([documentation](/integrations/enphase_envoy))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#97862]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97862

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ESPHome" %}

To prevent cross-linked devices, replacing an ESPHome device with a different
board is no longer allowed. Instead, delete the integration entry and re-add
the new device when the mac address of the board changes.

([@bdraco] - [#98787]) ([documentation](/integrations/esphome))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#98787]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98787

{% enddetails %}

{% details "EZVIZ" %}

Now, only returns switches if supported by the Camera. Some of the "switches" on
the EZVIZ API are intermingled with "is this supported" and are not actually
switchable; those have been removed.

([@RenierM26] - [#95672]) ([documentation](/integrations/ezviz))

[@RenierM26]: https://github.com/RenierM26
[#95672]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/95672

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Flume" %}

You might get false positives for leak detected and high flow sensors if you
have old unread notifications in the Flume app.

Before, the leak detected and high flow sensors would only trigger until you
read the notification in the Flume app which was too late for Home Assistant
to take any automated action.

Now, they trigger regardless if you have read or not the notification. They will
remain active until you delete the notification in the Flume app,
similar to [the old behavior documented](/integrations/flume/#notifications).

[@tronikos]: https://github.com/tronikos
[#98560]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98560

{% enddetails %}

[#97444]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97444

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HTTP / Webserver" %}

Home Assistant can't be put in an iframe anymore by default. If you still want
to embed the Home Assistant interface in a frame, you can do so by disabling
`use_x_frame_options` by setting it to `false` in the `http` configuration.

([@frenck] - [#97784]) ([documentation](/integrations/http))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#97784]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97784

{% enddetails %}

{% details "M√©t√©o-France" %}

The M√©t√©o-France weather entities have been updated:

- The `forecast` state attribute is deprecated and will be removed in
  Home Assistant Core 2024.3, you should instead use the `weather.get_forecast`
  service.
- The config entry option to select hourly or daily forecast can no longer be
  adjusted, but any existing configuration of the forecast period will be
  respected until Home Assistant Core 2024.3.
- M√©t√©o-France now provides a single weather entity which supports both
  hourly and daily forecast.

[#98022]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98022

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Mill" %}

Mill has moved to a new IoT solution and released a new API. The unique ID from
the old API is no longer available, so all devices will be shown as new devices.
Support for the heater fan will be added later.

([@Danielhiversen] - [#97497]) ([documentation](/integrations/mill))

[@Danielhiversen]: https://github.com/Danielhiversen
[#97497]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97497

{% enddetails %}

triggered if there is no change.

([@jbouwh] - [#98838]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#98838]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98838

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nextcloud" %}

The CPU load sensor has been replaced, it is not a list of 3 values anymore,
but there are now three single sensors for
CPU load within last 1, 5, and 15 minutes. 

([@mib1185] - [#99141]) ([documentation](/integrations/nextcloud))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#99141]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/99141

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Plugwise" %}

[#98153]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98153

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Start.ca" %}

Start.ca `limit`, `usage`, and `used_remaining` sensors will no longer be created
when there's no bandwidth cap.

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#98525]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98525

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Trafikverket Train" %}

All attributes have been converted into their own sensors.
The original sensor is now renamed with suffix "Departure time".

Any automation or script depending on these attributes needs to be adjusted
to use these new sensors.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#71432]) ([documentation](/integrations/trafikverket_train))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#71432]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/71432

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

The entity naming logic has been updated to be less brittle. As a result,
some `zwave_js` entities that you haven't given a custom name to may be renamed.

Since they are registered in the entity registry, the entity IDs will not change
and your automations should therefore not be impacted by the change.
