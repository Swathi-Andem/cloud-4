Ok you've made it this far you're interested in automating your home, but
Home-assistant has you stuck there are 3 ways to install it.. Which should you
choose?

*   Hass.io
*   Virtual Environment
*   Hassbian

This brief article will hopefully give you a starting point to make your
decision as all 3 are perfectly viable options.

### Option 1: Hass.io

This is the simplest option, it hides all that nasty code from you so can only edit the config files and all you have to do is click update in the UI and hey presto you have an updated install.

This is the best option for beginners or people that want that appliance "just works feel".

For those that like to get into the nitty gritty and tinker, it's the worst option.

### Option 2: Hassbian

You have a raspberry Pi, you want to be able to see and edit the internals & you're happy to dedicated that RPi to Home-assistant.

Simply download the image and install on the SD card

### Option 3: Virtual Environments

This is the most "complex" / flexible install (and I use complex in the loosest possible sense of the word). This is for when you dont want to dedicate your system to only home-assistant and / or you want to tweak the code / contribute back.
