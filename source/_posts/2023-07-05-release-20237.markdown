Services now can respond with data! üéâ

Yes, you read that right! This advanced feature is a huge step forward for
Home Assistant and will allow for a lot of new possibilities.

So, normally, calling a service in an automation or script, is a one-way
communication to control your devices and services. For example, turning on a
light, or play an announcement on your speakers.

So, what is the use of a service responding data? Well, it could be used to
ask for information from a device or service. For example, you could ask
Home Assistant which events are on your calendar today, and and use the
answer from that service call to create a notification or announcement.

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/427516175237382144/1123597217622663278/CleanShot_2023-06-28_at_14.53.44.png?width=2422&height=1462'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

We have two brand new service to play with:

- {% my developer_call_service service="conversation.process" %} - This
  service allows you to ask Assist a command or question, and get a response
  back.
- {% my developer_call_service service="conversation.process" %} - This service
  allows you to ask Home Assistant for a list of events on your calendar.

If you combine those in an automation, in the morning, you could ask
Home Assistant for todays calendar events, add things like weather information,
send it to ChatGPT using the conversation proceess and ask it to summerize it,
and send a notification to your phone with the result.

[@allenporter] has put this all togther in this Blueprint to play with:

<https://gist.github.com/allenporter/e70d9eb090c7dbdd593cf526e07b4abe>

This is just one example, but the possibilities are endless! It is exciting
to see what other creative use cases and new services with response will
be added in the future!

This feature is also added to scripts! So, you can make your scripts
respond and use that script response in your automations. This is a great way
to make your scripts more dynamic and flexible.

A special thanks to [@allenporter], who has been responsible for building out
the larger part of this feature!

## New entity dialog for Locks

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Add more info lock (#15995) @piitaya

{% enddetails %}

We are continuing to improve the entity dialogs. This time, we have reworked
a new dialog for locks. It looks great!

It looks similar to the entity dialog for the switch, but it has a few
extra features like asking for a unlock code and has a beautiful animation
when it is (un)locking.

## Open assist action

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

* Open assist from dashboard (#16829) @piitaya

{% enddetails %}

For the Year of the Voice, a brand new action for use in dashboard cards has
been added: The Assist action!

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/245445999-985c3a54-c951-40ad-9655-8c835ee6f578.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

With this brand new action, you can open Assist from your dashboards using, for
example, a button and even make Assist start listening right away. This can
be useful for use on a wall mounted tablet, for example.

## Sentence trigger

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Sentence trigger ([@synesthesiam] - [#94613]) ([conversation docs]) (noteworthy)
- Add UI for conversation trigger (#17037) @bramkragten

{% enddetails %}

Our [Assist](/voice_control/) is getting more and more powerful! This time,
we have added a new trigger to our automation editor that allows you to
trigger an automation when a sentence is said to the default Assist conversation
agent. ü§Ø

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/427516175237382144/1123602503330701422/CleanShot_2023-06-28_at_15.14.55.png'></a>

</p>

Creating an automation based on something that was said, has never been easier.

## Image entities

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Add Guest WiFi QR-Code image entity to AVM Fritz!Tools ([@mib1185] - [#95282]) ([fritz docs]) ([fritzbox_callmonitor docs]) (new-platform) (noteworthy)
- Add mqtt image platform ([@jbouwh] - [#94769]) ([mqtt docs]) (new-platform) (noteworthy)
- Add image platform to the template integration ([@emontnemery] - [#94928]) ([template docs]) ([image docs]) (noteworthy)
- Add support for image entity (#16877) @bramkragten

{% enddetails %}

There is a brand new entity type in town: [Image entities](/integrations/image/).

The image entity is very similar to the [camera entity](/integrations/camera/),
but instead of providing a live stream, it provides a single image. For example,
a QR-code that provides the WiFi credentials for your guest network, a weather
map, an image of the last motion detected by your camera, or just the cute cat
picture of the day!

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/247602059-8f3a322e-3e29-48a4-8b84-47dc22c9a878.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

Support for this brand new entity has been added to the [AVM Fritz!Box Tools](/integrations/fritz/),
for guest network access, and the [MQTT integration](/integrations/mqtt/) and
[Template integration](/integrations/template/) if you want to build your own.

## Copy 'n paste support in dashboards

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Show card positions in edit dashboard mode (#17055) @karwosts
- Support cut/copy/paste in dashboard UI editor (#16707) @karwosts

{% enddetails %}

In the previous release, [@karwosts] added the amazing [copy 'n paste feature](/blog/2023/06/07/release-20236/#copy-n-paste-support-in-the-automation-editor)
to our automation and script editors. This release, he is back with the same
feature for our dashboards!

You can now cut, copy, and paste cards between your dashboards, views and
even inside other nested cards. This makes it a lot easier to reorganize your
dashboards!

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32912880/242464648-bc2dd476-9acf-4ccf-a615-668f7dd949f1.gif'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

To make it even easier to reorganize your dashboards, it is mandatory to
understand the order of the cards across the differnt columns in your view.
So, a positional number is now shown when the your are in edit mode.

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32912880/249232766-b1a35c7c-d596-4cab-83dc-67502b1a3c58.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

Added bonus: Who needs drag 'n drop when you've got click 'n ...teleport? Click
on the number and you can input a new position for the card!

## New script dialog

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

{% enddetails %}

When you create a new automation, you'll get a nice dialog shown where you can
choose to create a new automation from scratch, or use one of your imported
blueprints as a starting point.

[@karwosts] has now added the same dialog to our script editor! üéâ

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32912880/246427640-34640dd1-9636-4a05-adb2-80a44874a9f5.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

Being able to set up scripts from Blueprints is great, as combined with the
brand new [service response](#services-call-can-now-respond) feature, these
become a lot more powerful and a lot more useful for sharing!

## Select timezone to use/display

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Allow to show times in the UI in the timezone of the server (#16799) @bramkragten

{% enddetails %}

You can now select which timezone the Home Assistant interface should use
in your user profile. This is useful if you are traveling or if you have
family members in different timezones.

You can select to use the timezone of your current location, or you can
choose to use the timezone that your Home Assistant server is in. The
Home Assistant frontend will adjust all off the date & times to the
selected timezone.

## Iteration on the integrations dashboard

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

{% enddetails %}

Last release we introduced new [integrations dashboards & pages](/blog/2023/06/07/release-20236/#integrations-dashboard--pages),
which was very well received. Yet, there has been some feedback on the
dashboard, and we have been working on improving it.

The main goal, was to make it feel less busy and more familiar and consistent
with all other UI elements.

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/249429574-eb6f4e82-2845-47f0-b488-4ddc8572bcfc.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

The cards shown are now more consistent with the rest of Home Assistant and the
full header item is now clickable. The cog, device and service items
have been removed and the indicators for custom integrations and cloud services
are no longer overlapping the logos.

## Reducing the risk of running into breaking changes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Decide if we should keep this?
  Maybe add it as an intro to the breaking changes section?
- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

{% enddetails %}

Breaking changes, nobody loves them, but they are sometimes necessary to move
forward. We try to keep them to an absolute minimum, but sometimes they are
inevitable.

However, we do want to reduce the risk of running into them. Therefore we have
adopted [a new policy for deprecating YAML integration configuration options][adr].

We now require that a YAML configuration option is deprecated for at least 6
months before it is removed. This means, if you skip a release or two, you won't
be running into a hard breaking change.

To even improve on this further, if possible, an automatic migration is required
and an issue in the repairs dashboard will be raised if the deprecation applies
to your configuration.

Hopefully this helps reducing the frustration of running into breaking changes.

## Unavailable automations and scripts

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Set automations which fail validation unavailable ([@emontnery] - [#94856]) ([automation docs]) (noteworthy)
- Set scripts which fail validation unavailable ([@emontnemery] - [#95381]) ([script docs]) (noteworthy)
- Show if script is unavailable and why (#17051) @bramkragten
- Show if automation is unavailable and why (#17048) @bramkragten

{% enddetails %}

Automations and scripts are awesome! They can add a lot of confort to your
home, but they have a weird quirk. If they have an error, they would just
disappear from Home Assistant.

This is no longer the case! If an automation or script has an error, it will
now show up as unavailable in the UI. Selecting such an automation will show
you the error message, so you know what is going on and what to fix.

- Bump bluetooth-data-tools to 1.2.0 ([@bdraco] - [#94696]) ([esphome docs]) ([bluetooth docs]) ([led_ble docs]) ([ld2410_ble docs]) (dependency) (noteworthy)

{% enddetails %}

Bluetooth proxies are now even faster! Like... really fast!
When using the latest ESPHome and this release of Home Assistant, it will
be so much faster that we should actually recommend using over an native
Bluetooth stick.

## Matter updates

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Change subscription logic for Matter devices ([@marcelveldt] - [#95387]) ([matter docs]) (dependency) (noteworthy)

- Startup time (especially with a large number of nodes) is now blazing fast (from minutes to seconds)
- Even faster state updates
- Changes to bridges are now instantly detected (e.g. adding a new bridged device or removing one)
- Better logging of all activity
- If one or more nodes are unavailable, it will no longer hold up subscriptions and interviews for other devices.
- Climate support has been added **(NOTE: pending merge, unsure...)**

## Other noteworthy changes

the backup was initiated (`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`, for example,

temperature unit if this is not degrees Celsius.

---

The behavior of MQTT climate when `power_command_topic` is set has been changed:

- The `hvac_mode` state attribute is no longer optimistically set if
  `power_command_topic` is defined and `climate.turn_on` or `climate.turn_off`
  is called.
- When `hvac_mode` is changed, `payload_on` or `payload_off` messages will
  not be published on the `power_command_topic`.

This also means `power_command_topic` is no longer deprecated.

{% details "MusicCast" %}

If you have any automation depending on the `source` state attribute of the
media player entity, you will have to update these, because we want to show
more user friendly values such as "Net Radio" instead of net_radio. Calling
the `select_source` service will still be possible using the old source names.
