Home Assistant Core 2022.12! üéÑ

Already the last release of the year, right on time to bring you some cool
new features to work with during the upcoming Holidays!

2022 has been a fantastic year for the Home Assistant project. We became
one of the world's largest and [fastest-growing GitHub open source projects](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/state-of-open-source)! ‚ù§Ô∏è Tons of new features [each month](/blog/categories/core/), and not just that,
we matured a lot! Everything became more stable and faster, and
the UX made leaps forwards as well!

We looked back at 2022 during the [State of the Open Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D936T1Ze8-4),
and sneak peaked at 2023, with some great new UI concepts
and:_The year of the voice!_ üó£Ô∏è Missed it?
[The full video is available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D936T1Ze8-4).

But! The year isn't over yet! This release really Matters! We are thrilled to
be one of the first in the world to roll out Matter support to the public! üéâ

No Matter devices yet? Don't worry! There are tons of things in this release
that will keep you busy. The Tile card got "features"! You can now extend
your Bluetooth range using Shelly devices, and a long-requested feature lands:
Local Calendar. ü§©

For 2022, this is it! Thank you for joining our community. Thank you for
sharing, helping out, contributing, creating YouTube videos, blog articles,
and podcasts.

**Thank you for using Home Assistant!** ‚ù§Ô∏è

Happy holidays and for the last time in 2022: Enjoy the release!

## It does Matter!

Does it Matter? Yes, Home Assistant does Matter!

Matter is a new smart home interoperability standard, an open-source protocol,
that defines how devices can communicate and work together. Read more about
Matter in this [comprehensive write-up from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer).

Today we release the first iteration of the Matter integration for Home
Assistant. It is a big and important foundation that is probably best described
as "alpha" or maybe even a "developer preview" ‚Äî allowing anyone to help
and jump in on the Matter development. For the first release,
we think that is a great start!

At this point, Matter-enabled products are not (yet) generally available.
However, if you can get a Matter-certified product, it can be commissioned!

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-12/matter.png' alt='A screenshot of a Matter device showing up in Home Assistant'>
A Matter device integrated with Home Assistant.
</p>

Adding Matter devices (commissioning) can be done using our iOS and Android
Home Assistant Companion apps. Adding support for this to our apps is being
worked on and will become available in the upcoming weeks. The Android Companion
app supporting Matter, is currently available for [beta testing](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.homeassistant.companion.android).

Interested? We have made more details available [in our documentation](/integrations/matter).

## Tile card gets features

In the last release, we [introduced the Tile card](/blog/2022/11/02/release-202211/#tile-card).
Today we extend the Tile card by adding support for "features".

For the Tile card, "features" are additional extras that can be added to a Tile
card. For example, they can provide additional controls or information for
the entity the Tile card displays.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-12/tile-features.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new features that can be added to tile cards'>

Multiple usable Tile features have been added:

- Command buttons for vacuum cleaners
- Brightness slider for lights
- Controls for opening/closing and tilting covers

[Checkout the documentation for more information about Tile features](/dashboards/tile/#tile-features)

But that is not all! The Tile card also got colors! üé®

Based on the entity's state, the card will get different colors. This color
provides an additional visual indication of the entity's state.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-12/tile-colors.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new state colors provided by the Tile card'>

## State colors!

Those lovely new state colors added to the Tile card, as shown above, are not
just added to the tile card. This same color logic has now also been applied to
the state history and the logbook!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-12/state-colors.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new state colors in history and logbooks'>

Previously, these colors would be random. Now they are predictable, recognizable
and, above all: just look a lot better ü§©

This same experience will also be visible on the dedicated Logbook and History
pages of course.

## Local calendar

This is one of the longer outstanding and bigger requested features
of Home Assistant: A local calendar!

Building a calendar isn't easy, but [Allen Porter] did it! And it is not
just a calendar with dates and descriptions... oh no! Allen went all in!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-12/local-calendar.png' alt='Screenshot adding an event to the local calendar'>

We now have a full blown, local, built-in calendar, which can do all-day event
or recurring ones tuned to your liking. Even multiple different local calendars
are supported!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-12/local-calendar-repeating.png' alt='Screenshot adding recurring events to the local calendar'>

## Bluetooth proxy using Shelly devices

In the September release, we brought [Bluetooth everywhere],
by adding Bluetooth proxy support, allowing any ESPHome device in your home
to relay Bluetooth traffic across your home.

This release adds support for using Shelly devices are a remote Bluetooth
adapter as well!

It works with all second-generation Shelly devices that use firmware 12.0 or
later. Those are able to provide Bluetooth advertisements to Home Assistant's
[Bluetooth integration](/integration/bluetooth).

This can greatly help with extending the range of your Bluetooth network to
help with things like Bluetooth temperature or plant sensors in your home.

In other Bluetooth news: The performance of Bluetooth has, again, been improved
this release, and the memory usage should be lower. Always good!

## New entity: `text`

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve story
- Spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshots

{% enddetails %}

Say hello to a new entity: `text`! The text entity is very similar to the
[Text helper](/integrations/input_text) (also known as `input_text`).

The difference is that the helper is configured and managed by you, while the
new text entities are provided by integrations. This means integration can now
provide entities that ask for a textual input in the UI.

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/195327/203792730-8a2416ec-6a74-4447-aba4-5b5182e497c8.png' alt='Lorem ipsum'>
Note: Placeholder screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/195327/203792745-60013f73-4929-424b-b558-e1f39b9a1682.png' alt='Lorem ipsum'>
Note: Placeholder screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

The first integrations that can now provide text entities as of this release are
[KNX](/integrations/knx#text) and [MQTT](/integrations/text.mqtt).

## Summing entities without templates

{% details "TODO" %}

- Iterate on story
- Spelling/grammar
- Try improve screenshot, it is a little hard to read

{% enddetails %}

Let's say you have two numeric sensor entities, and you like to have an
entity that shows the sum of those two; how would you do that? Creating a
template entity, right? Nope! üòÅ

You can now create a new helper entity that sums the values of two (or more)
sensor entities into a brand-new entity.

When creating a new helper, select "Combine the state of several sensors",
pick the sensor you'd like to sum, and select "Sum" for the statistic
characteristic. Voila!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-12/sum.png' alt='Screenshot showing you can now combine and sum up multiple sensor entities'>

{% my config_flow_start badge domain="min_max" %}

You might have noticed that this looks like the "Min/Max" helper. True!
We have renamed "Min/Max" to "Combine the state of several sensors",
to make it more descriptive as it gets more features.

## Improved state coloring

{% details "TODO" %}

- Add on story
- Spelling/grammar
- Add/replace screenshots
- Keep it? Or move to other noteworthy?

{% enddetails %}

The new Tile card gets its colors based on the state of the entity it displays.
This same color logic has now also been applied to the state history
and the logbook.

This makes the colors predictable, recognizable and above all: just looks a lot
better ü§©

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/200536889-ea6c2e0c-a027-44cc-8ae5-9a2b9fd286bb.png' alt='Lorem ipsum'>

Note: Placeholder screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

## Other noteworthy changes

Entity more info dialog merged with entity settings.

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Last minute ones added?
- Go over list again, might have missed something

**Note**: Changes processed up to PR 81536

## Breaking Changes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar

**Note**: Breaking changes processed up to PR 78465

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Cloudflare" %}

The Cloudflare integration no longer relies on ipify.org to determine your IP,
but instead is using the [whoami service](https://github.com/home-assistant/services.home-assistant.io).

This means that if you have configured your network only to allow traffic there,
you would need to adjust it to allow for the new situation.

([@ludeeus] - [#81714]) ([documentation](/integrations/cloudflare))

[@ludeeus]: https://github.com/ludeeus
[#81714]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81714

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Elexa Guardian" %}

The previously deprecated `guardian.disable_ap` and `guardian.enable_ap` service
and the corresponding binary sensor have now been removed.

([@bachya] - [#81056]) ([documentation](/integrations/guardian))

[@bachya]: https://github.com/bachya
[#81056]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81056

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Glances" %}

The scan interval (`scan_interval`) option in the Glances configuration is
removed, and the update interval will use the default value (60 seconds).

If you have already configured Glances integrations, the previously saved interval
option will still be used. To revert to the default update interval,
you need to re-add the integration.

You can use the `homeassistant.update_entity` service in an automation
for custom update intervals.

[@engrbm87]: https://github.com/engrbm87
[#72748]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72748

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Groups" %}

Media player groups containing players that provide an invalid media player
entity state, will now report a "Unknown" group state.

The list of valid media player states is available in our
[developer documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/media-player/#states).

([@epenet] - [#78465]) ([documentation](/integrations/group))

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#78465]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/78465

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HERE Travel Time" %}

The HERE Travel Time integration now uses the HERE API v8.
Travelmode `publicTransportTimeTable` has been merged into `publicTransport`.
Your configuration will be migrated automatically;
no manual interaction is necessary.

([@eifinger] - [#80892]) ([documentation](/integrations/here_travel_time))

[@eifinger]: https://github.com/eifinger
[#80892]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/80892

---

The unit system is no longer controlled by an options setting of the HERE
Traveltime integration but uses the built-in custom units configurable per
entity.

The distance sensor now uses kilometers as a default and must be manually
configured if it was previously using the imperial system.

([@eifinger] - [#79159]) ([documentation](/integrations/here_travel_time))

[@eifinger]: https://github.com/eifinger
[#79159]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/79159

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Hikvision" %}

The videoloss event has been removed from the supported list. The event has
always been used as a keep-alive for most Hikvision devices, and the library
uses it internally. Leaving it enabled as an option causes everything to break
if the event is actually processed, so it was removed to eliminate confusion.

Any customized options specified in the YAML configuration for a videoloss
event will need to be removed, and videoloss entities will no longer be
generated by the integration.

If you used any of these entities in your automations or scripts, you will
need to update those to remove the use of these entities.

[@mezz64]: https://github.com/mezz64
[#81173]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81173

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit" %}

The HomeKit Air quality PM10 mappings between Home Assistant and HomeKit,
have been updated to the latest [US AQI standard](https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept2018.pdf).

[#81217]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81217

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Logitech Harmony Hub" %}

The `PowerOff` state of the select entity will be changed to `power_off`.

If you relied on this state value in your automations or script,
you must adjust to this change.

([@bieniu] - [#77491]) ([documentation](/integrations/harmony))

[@bieniu]: https://github.com/bieniu
[#77491]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/77491

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Mobile Apps" %}

The events fired when the mobile app scanned a Tag had an incorrect device ID;
This has been corrected.

As a result, the evens now contain a different but correct device ID. If you
relied on the device ID in your automations, you might need to adjust those
with the new device ID.

([@balloob] - [#82820]) ([documentation](/integrations/mobile_app))

[@balloob]: https://github.com/balloob
[#82820]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/82820

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Modbus" %}

The name of the mapping keys used for defining HVAC modes in the Modbus
climate integration (introduced in 2022.11) has changed. This was needed
to fix an issue with the `off` key, which has a different meaning in YAML.

Instead of:

```yaml
hvac_mode_register:
  address: ...
  values:
    off: 0
    heat: 1
    cool: 2
```

You now have to use:

```yaml
hvac_mode_register:
  address: ...
  values:
    state_off: 0
    state_heat: 1
    state_cool: 2
```

[@avishorp]: https://github.com/avishorp
[#81747]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81747

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

YAML configuration of MQTT entities under the platform key (e.g., `light`),
which was deprecated in Home Assistant Core 2022.6, is no longer supported.
The configuration must instead be done under the `mqtt` key.

The legacy MQTT device tracker is no longer supported. See 
[the documentation](/integrations/device_tracker.mqtt/) for the supported MQTT
device tracker configuration.

As of this release, you should now use the modern configuration schema for all
manually configured MQTT entities. Please note that this does not impact
MQTT discovery, for example, Zigbee2MQTT.

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#82102]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/82102

---

The `encoding` configuration option for the MQTT camera set to `b64`
was previously deprecated and has now become an invalid configuration.

The new `image_encoding` configuration option is now used to set Base64 encoding.
Please use the new `image_encoding` config parameter (set to `b64`) instead.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenUV" %}

The previously deprecated `openuv.update`, `openuv.update_uv_index`,
and `openuv.update_protection_data` services have now be removed.

([@bachya] - [#81055]) ([documentation](/integrations/openuv))

[@bachya]: https://github.com/bachya
[#81055]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81055

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Radarr" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Radarr
integration has been removed.

Radarr is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

([@tkdrob] - [#81210]) ([documentation](/integrations/radarr))

[@tkdrob]: https://github.com/tkdrob
[#81210]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81210

{% enddetails %}

{% details "RainMachine" %}

The previously deprecated `extra_water_on_hot_days`  and `freeze_protection`
binary sensors, and `freeze_protection_temperature` sensor have now been removed.

([@bachya] - [#81053]) ([documentation](/integrations/rainmachine))

[@bachya]: https://github.com/bachya
[#81053]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81053

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Renault" %}

The unit of measurement for the charging power sensor has been corrected.
As the unit has changed, it will create a long-term statistics warning
that you need to resolve in the statistics developers tools manually.

{% my developer_statistics badge %}

([@epenet] - [#81412]) ([documentation](/integrations/renault))

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#81412]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81412

You will need to resolve the analytics warning by adjusting the previous unit.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Risco" %}

The `bypassed` attribute in Risco zones has been removed and replaced with
a switch. The matching services have also been removed, and you can bypass
and un-bypass a zone using the regular switch services
(`turn_on` and `turn_off` respectively).

For example, if you had a call to:

```yaml
service: risco.bypass_zone
target:
  entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_bedroom
```

You can replace it with:

```yaml
service: switch.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: switch.motion_bedroom_bypassed
```

[#81137]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81137

{% enddetails %}

{% details "SimpliSafe" %}

The previously deprecated `simplisafe.clear_notifications` service
has now been removed.

([@bachya] - [#81054]) ([documentation](/integrations/simplisafe))

[@bachya]: https://github.com/bachya
[#81054]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81054

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Statistics" %}

The `quantiles` `statistics` sensor characteristic has been removed and
replaced by the more versatile `percentile` characteristic.

If you use the `quantiles` characteristic, you will need to adapt your sensor
configuration to recreate identical values with the `percentile` characteristic.

([@ThomDietrich] - [#81749]) ([documentation](/integrations/statistics))

[@ThomDietrich]: https://github.com/ThomDietrich
[#81027]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/81027

---

The configuration of `statistics` sensors has changed:

The `state_characteristic` configuration setting is now mandatory.

The `sampling_size` configuration setting is now optional and no longer
defaults to the arbitrary value 20. You can now define `sampling_size`,
`max_age`, or both depending on your use case. Existing sensors won't behave
differently by the change. However, you might want to check whether your
currently defined sensors have a meaningful `sampling_size` configured or if
you wish to remove this setting altogether.

As new PoE entities were introduced with 2022.11, this release, the old
troublesome PoE client implementation that these entities replaced,
has been removed. Upgrading will automatically remove the old entities.

Please note that the new PoE entities are disabled by default and represent
each PoE-capable port without mapping it to a client.
