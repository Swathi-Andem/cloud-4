Last week TP-Link released an update for their HS100 and HS110 plugs that removed the local API. This was done because of a "security concern". I put this in quotes because it has not been verified and this reason has been given before when removing interopability.

Lots of users got, rightfully so, angry. They bought the plugs assuming the local API was a feature. Removing this feature and forcing users through the TP-Link cloud is unacceptable.

It looks like TP-Link has listenedâ€¦ _somewhat_. They are offering a temporary solution to rollback the firmware. We haven't found any public documentation but there are forum posts by their employees [here](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/236268#topic-reply-523030) and [here](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/237614#topic-reply-520984) about it.

We are hoping for a better solution, but for now this is what you should do:

1. Submit a ticket at [technical support](https://www.tp-link.com/nl/support/contact-technical-support/#E-mail-Support)
2. Go to the forums and send [this user](https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/uc/info/650029) a message with your ticket ID and MAC address.

TP-Link, if you're reading along, please reach out to us at hello@home-assistant.io so we can discuss a better long term solution for local control. Happy to talk!
