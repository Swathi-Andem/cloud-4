## Introducing Assist!

{% details "TODO" %}

- Add story
- Spelling/grammar
- Add links to new documentation for it
- Remove livestream embed, reference/link it instead.
- Add aliases to areas #15198
- Load custom sentences from config directory ([@synesthesiam] - [#85558]) ([conversation docs]) (noteworthy)

{% enddetails %}

Not going to spoil too much beans during the beta yet... but you absolutely
want to go and watch the livestream on Thursday, 26 January, at 12:00 PST / 21:00 CET!

Join us today to learn about new assistant features for Home Assistant.

<lite-youtube videoid="ixgNT3RETPg" videotitle="Home Assistant Year of the Voice - Chapter 1"></lite-youtube>

It's [Home Assistant's Year of the Voice](/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/) and
it's our goal to let users control Home Assistant in their own language. With
the Home Assistant community we've been hard at work on building the foundation
and add support to control Home Assistant in 39 different languages.

But if you really want to get a taste on what is going on... you might notice a
little new icon here:

Note: This is a temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.
</p>

## Streaming history

{% details "TODO" %}

- Add story
- Spelling/grammar
- Add fresh animation?
- Add support for streaming (push) history ([@bdraco] - [#85892]) ([history docs]) (noteworthy)
- Increase default recorder commit interval to 5 seconds ([@bdraco] - [#86115]) ([recorder docs]) (breaking-change) (noteworthy)
- Improve performance of fetching and storing history and events with the database ([@bdraco] - [#84870]) ([recorder docs]) (breaking-change) (noteworthy)
- Add support for streaming history (#15112) @bdraco
  - https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/15112
- Should also resolve more authentication errors/bans (e.g. on iOS)

{% enddetails %}

Graphs shown in history, are now (streaming) updates live! That means
you can see them update in real-time üò≤

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663432/212584923-2148b052-d1d8-4e26-a958-1a21c98078bb.gif' alt='Temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.'></a>
Note: This is a temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.
</p>

As a result of that, we can now write less frequently to the database in our
recorder. It took years of changes to get us to this point (thanks [@bdraco] üôè),
it greatly reduces I/O and increases storage lifetimes significantly. The
previously introduces live logbook and now the live history are only the last
pieces that made this possible.

As a side-effect, it should also resolve the authentication errors some people
experienced when re-opening the iOS companion app.

## Sensor groups

{% details "TODO" %}

- Add story
- Spelling/grammar
- Keep or move to other noteworthy?
- Add sensor to group ([@gjohansson-ST] - [#83186]) ([group docs]) (new-platform) (noteworthy)

{% enddetails %}

You can now create sensor groups! To add one, go to Settings -> Device & Services
-> Helpers tab -> Create helper -> Group -> Sensor group.

Sensor groups are able to combine sensor, number and number helpers entities.

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/195327/214066635-82a56f21-bd33-4adf-b292-d7023817b550.png' alt='Temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.'></a>
Note: This is a temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.
</p>

## Sensor precision

{% details "TODO" %}

- Add story
- Spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

{% enddetails %}

Got a sensor that has too many decimals in its numeric value? You'd like it to
round it to a single, or maybe even no decimals at all?

Just ~~create a template sensor~~ change it directly from the UI!

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14281572/214518675-8d663617-59f2-4aa6-b8f0-fded2355f4c5.png' alt='Temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.'></a>
Note: This is a temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.
</p>

This is an true entity setting, which means that changing the precision, will
actually affect your entity state. So, it applies not just to your dashboard,
but everything that uses the entity, including automations.

## Now even more integrated with ESPHome

{% details "TODO" %}

- Add story
- Spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot of an ESPHome device updating?
- Add ESPHome update entities ([@balloob] - [#85717]) ([esphome docs]) (new-platform) (noteworthy)
- Handle ESPHome dashboard discovery ([@balloob] - [#85662]) ([esphome docs]) (noteworthy)
- Automatically fetch the encryption key from the ESPHome dashboard ([@balloob] - [#85709]) ([esphome docs]) (noteworthy)
- Add friendly name support for ESPHome ([@jesserockz] - [#85976]) ([esphome docs]) (dependency) (noteworthy)
- Update ESPHome devices from HA ([@balloob] - [#86249]) ([esphome docs]) (noteworthy)

{% enddetails %}

ESPHome already works really well with Home Assistant, yet, this release
makes it even better!

As of the next release of ESPHome: add a friendly, more human name
to your ESPHome devices. Home Assistant will pick those up, making your
ESPHome devices look better in Home Assistant out of the box.

Talking about out of the box experience, we added some features in case you
are using the ESPHome add-on. The ESPHome add-on and Home Assistant will now
communicate with each other, bringing in a lot of new features.

When you set up a new device in ESPHome and next add it to Home Assistant,
they will be able to exchange encryption keys with each other. Removing the
need for you to find, copy & paste those. Just a single click and setup is
done!

But that is not all, what is really mind blowing, is that the ESPHome integration
will now provide update entites when using the ESPHome add-on! Yes, you
can update your ESPHome devices directly from Home Assistant and even automate
with them!

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1444314/211913429-973b6e05-b0ee-4686-b789-799cd4d73e9d.png' alt='Temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.'></a>

## Breaking Changes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Update docs for:
  - Fix logic of disabled condition for "OR" ([@karliemeads] - [#79718]) (breaking-change)


**Note**: Breaking changes processed up to PR 86470

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Python 3.9 support has been removed" %}

Python 3.9 support has previously been deprecated and now has been removed.
Home Assistant now requires Python 3.10 to run.

If you are using Home Assistant OS, Home Assistant Container, or Home Assistant
Supervised installation method, you don‚Äôt have to do anything. In those cases,
we handle this all for you.

Your system has been using Python 3.10 for quite some time already.

([@frenck] - [#85456])

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#85456]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85456

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Automations & Scripts" %}

A disabled condition, in for example an automation or script, will no longer
always be a pass/`True` within an `OR` condition. Instead, in those
cases the condition will now have no effect when disabled.

([@karliemeads] - [#79718]) ([documentation](/integrations/automations))

[@karliemeads]: https://github.com/karliemeads
[#79718]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/79718

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AccuWeather" %}

For precipitation entity, the unit was changed from `mm` to `mm/h`
(`in` to `in/h`), which will result in the need to fix the unit for 
long-term statistics. You can do that in `Developer Tools` -> `Stats`.

([@bieniu] - [#86088]) ([documentation](/integrations/accuweather))

[@bieniu]: https://github.com/bieniu
[#86088]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86088

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Airly" %}

If the language in the Home Assistant settings is set to Polish, the language
of the `advice` and `description` attributes of the CAQI entity will change
from English to Polish.

If you are using these in your automations or scripts, you might need to adjust
them to match this change.

([@bieniu] - [#85655]) ([documentation](/integrations/airly))

[@bieniu]: https://github.com/bieniu
[#85655]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85655

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Fitbit" %}

The state values of the Fitbit sensor entities will change to remove any
thousands delimiters. For example: `1,500` will become `1500`.

If you're using the state of these entities in automations or scripts,
you need to update them to handle the new state format.

([@sw-carlos-cristobal] - [#85251]) ([documentation](/integrations/fitbit))

[@sw-carlos-cristobal]: https://github.com/sw-carlos-cristobal
[#85251]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85251

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Flume" %}

The scan/update interval for water values has been restored to match the Flume
app.

To stay under Flume's API limits, the device connection is now checked hourly,
and notifications are checked every 5 minutes.

([@bdraco] - [#86354]) ([documentation](/integrations/flume))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#86354]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86354

{% enddetails %}

{% details "History" %}

The `use_include_order` YAML configuration option has been removed.

This option was used to sort the history on the original history panel which
is no longer used. As it no longer has a function and only serves to
slow down the response it has been removed.

([@bdraco] - [#86365]) ([documentation](/integrations/history))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#86365]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86365

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IoTaWatt" %}

The IoTAWatt integration no longer provides sensors with the "Accumulated"
suffix. The accumulated sensor have been introduced to support net energy
export/import metering.

Newer versions of IoTaWatt provide "Integrators", which allow to achieve the
same more efficiently and with higher accuracy.

You should configure [Integrators](https://docs.iotawatt.com/en/master/integrators.html)
to calculate the net energy export and import.

([@agners] - [#86611]) ([documentation](/integrations/iotawatt))

[@agners]: https://github.com/agners
[#86611]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86611

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Matter" %}

The Matter integration now requires running Matter Server version `2.0.0`.

If you're using the Matter Server add-on to run the Matter Server,
you will need version `3.0.0` of the add-on.

We had to change our vendor ID in the add-on, as a result of this, all devices
need to be recommissioned.

([@MartinHjelmare] - [#86470]) ([documentation](/integrations/matter))

[@MartinHjelmare]: https://github.com/MartinHjelmare
[#86470]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86470

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nettigo Air Monitor" %}

The states of air quality sensors have been standardized to match Home Assistant
core rules. This affects 2 states some sensors of NAM can provide:

- `very low`, which now became `very_low`
- `very high`, which now became `very_high`

If you used those states directly in your automations, scripts, or templates;
you will need to adjust those to match these changes.

([@frenck] - [#85245]) ([documentation](/integrations/nam))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#85245]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85245

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Pentair ScreenLogic" %}

The Pentair ScreenLogic integration now correctly categorizes all known lights.
It may be necessary to remove any lights that were previously incorrectly
created as switch entities.

([@dieselrabbit] - [#86608]) ([documentation](/integrations/screenlogic))

[@dieselrabbit]: https://github.com/dieselrabbit
[#86608]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86608

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Pi-hole" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Pi-hole
integration has been removed.

Pi-hole is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML configuration
has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely removed from your
YAML configuration files.

([@mib1185] - [#84803]) ([documentation](/integrations/pi_hole))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#84803]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/84803

---

The extra state attribute "Domains blocked" has been removed from all sensors.
It is already exposed as own, dedicated, sensor.

If you used the state attribute in your automations or scripts, you will
need to adjust them to use the dedicated sensor instead.

([@mib1185] - [#85424]) ([documentation](/integrations/pi_hole))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#85424]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85424

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Rain Bird" %}

Rainbird is now configured via the UI and configuration from YAML has been
imported automatically.

However, there are a few notable changes:

- Custom per zone overrides for irrigation time are no longer supported.
- The Rain delay `binary_sensor` that duplicates the Rain delay time `sensor`
  has been removed. You should move all uses to the `sensor` value and check
  for a non-zero value to get equivalent behavior.
- The Rain `sensor` that duplicates the Rain `binary_sensor` has been removed.
  You may check the `binary_sensor` state to get equivalent behavior.

Also, the way the "Rain Delay" is managed has changed. The Rain Delay, which
pauses irrigation for a specified number of days, is now manage with a Number
entity which can be controlled directly from the UI.

The existing service call `rainbird.set_rain_delay` and the Raindelay sensor
have been deprecated. Any existing automations or scripts that make service
calls to `rainbird.set_rain_delay` will need to be replaced with a call
to `number.set_value`. Additionally, the existing service call was updated to
require a integration entry configuration since it previously had undefined
behavior, so it is recommend to move directly to the new number service call.

([@allenporter] - [#85271] [#86208]) ([documentation](/integrations/rainbird))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#85271]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85271
[#86208]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86208

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Recorder" %}

The recorder's default commit interval has been increased to 5 seconds to
reduce disk I/O and increase storage longevity.

As the history and logbook integrations both support live streaming, which
avoids the need to read the database after the initial sync, there is no
remaining core functionality that needs a lower commit interval.

The [`commit_interval`](/integrations/recorder/#commit_interval) can be adjusted
to a lower value in the event an integration that has not been be updated
to watch for events instead of reading the database needs
to read the database sooner.

{% details "Sony Bravia TV" %}

Sony Bravia TV media players no longer have fake (assumed) `playing` or `paused`
states and those are replaced with the `on` state.

If you have automations or scripts that use the `playing` or `paused` state,
please be sure to update them to be compatible with this change.

---

The `source_list` no longer contains a list of applications and TV channels.
Apps and channels have been separated from the input list and moved
to the Media Browser.

If you have automations or scripts that use `media_player.select_source` to
switch apps or channels on the Bravia TV, the automations need to be
updated to use `media_player.play_media` service instead.

The options flow has been removed from the integration, as the only one
configurable setting `ignored_sources` was no longer relevant
and incompatible to this change.

need to adjust those to this change.

ISY/IoX Variables have been moved from `sensor` entities to `number` entities;
the existing `sensor` entities are deprecated and will be removed in a future
release.

entities or service.

Entities for INSTEON Aux Properties and Device Communication Errors have been
removed for nodes that are not the main (load) node.

On Level and Ramp Rate sensors have been removed for non-dimmable (non-`light.`)
devices. Only load devices receive communication error updates and only
dimmable devices support `OL` and `RR` command. 

The other entities were previously added but do not receive valid states from
the ISY or end-devices. These sensors were disabled by default.
