## Restarting Home Assistant

Since we started redesigning our menu structure (a little over a year
ago), "Restarting" Home Assistant has been a source of discussion in our
community. Home Assistant can be restarted, reloaded, rebooted,
and powered off; it quickly became unclear what to use and when.

We've come up with a solution inspired by the good old Windows XP computer
turn-off screen. [@matthiasdebaat] made a UX that has been implemented
by [@piitaya] that will hopefully make this all better, more clear.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-03/restart-home-assistant.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new restart dialog of Home Assistant that provides a guidance on what action to take.'>

Nice, right? ü§© What is entirely new is the first item shown: "Quick reload".
Quick reload calls all active integrations in your system that support
reloading YAML configuration on the fly üöÄ.

This means all integrations individually listed as reloadable under the YAML
tab in the developer tools are reloaded simultaneously! Also, [@frenck] made
quick reload available as a {% my developer_call_service service="homeassistant.reload_all" title="service" %},
so you can automate with it.

Lastly, another place for finding it more easily; the option to restart has
also been added to the three-dotted overflow menu in the top right of the
settings screen.

## Asking Assist for the current state of things

This release updates Assist with the capability to ask for the state of things
around your home. For example:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-03/ask-assist-for-states.png' alt='Screenshot showing the assist conversation dialog demonstrating new new intents to get the state of things in your home.'>

Intents for three types of questions have been added:

- Ask for the state of a single entity:
  - _"What is the outside temperature?"_
  - _"Is the front door locked?"_
  - _"What is the power consumption in the office?"_
- Any or all questions:
  - _"Are any lights on in the bedroom?"_
  - _"Are all windows closed in the kitchen?"_
- How many or which questions:
  - _"How many lights on are in the office?"_
  - _"Which doors are open?"_

Thanks, [@synesthesiam] for implementing this, and thanks to language leaders
and contributors for helping out providing translations for all these [intents]! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Want to help with adding support for these intents in your language? Please do!

## Cleaner entity information dialogs

The entity information dialog (also known as the more-info dialogs) got some
nice improvements in this release.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-03/new-entity-dialog.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new entity information dialogs, highlighting the top bar changes.'>

The "Info", "History", "Settings", and "Related" tabs have been removed, which
gives the dialog a much cleaner look. Icons for settings and history have been
added in the top right to replace these tabs. The new three-dotted overflow menu
can bring up related entity information and provides a direct link to the device
dashboard of the device that provided this entity.

Nice job [@matthiasdebaat] and [@piitaya]!

## New dialogs for lights, switches and siren entities

{% details "TODO" %}

- Extend story
- Spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot / screenrecording
  Maybe combine a couple in a single screenshot?
  ref: https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/15482

{% enddetails %}

There is more to tell about the more-info dialogs this release,
as [@matthiasdebaat] and [@piitaya] have been working on the designs shared
[during the State of the Open Home 2022](https://www.youtube.com/live/D936T1Ze8-4?feature=share&t=5193).
This release brings in the first overhauls to the entity dialogs of light,
switch and siren entities.

## Sensor precision

Got a sensor that has too many decimals in its numeric value? You'd like it to
round it to a single, or maybe even no decimals at all?

Just ~~create a template sensor~~ change it directly from the UI!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-03/entity-precision.png' alt='Screenshot showing you can now set the numerical
precision of an sensor entity value from the entity settings dialog.'>

Thanks [@emontnemery] for building out this feature!

This has also been extended into integrations, which now can provide
a more precise value while suggesting to, show it with less precision
by default. This allows you to change it if you don't like the defaults.

When writing templates, you can also take advantage of the configured precision,
as the `states()` function has been extended to help with that.
You can find more information on
[formatting sensor states in the templating documentation](/docs/configuration/templating/#formatting-sensor-states).

## New create automation dialog

{% details "TODO" %}

- Eextend story
- Add some recent screenshots
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

The dialog you see when you create a new automation, was given a facelift by
[@piitaya].

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/216008015-369893ae-f393-4c68-8e4c-d9a297f75d58.png' alt='Temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.'></a>
Note: This is a temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.
</p>

You may notice it now show author information in this dialog. If you create
Blueprints, you can add [author information] to your Blueprint,
which will be shown in this dialog.

## Thread & Matter

{% details "TODO" %}

- Add/extend story, sum up what has become available this release.
- Add some recent screenshots
- Spelling/grammar
- Add "add matter device" link to add integration dialog (#15365) @bramkragten
- Add color support to matter lights ([@ArturoGuerra] - [#87366]) ([matter docs]) (noteworthy)

{% enddetails %}

Behind the scenes, a lot is happening adding, extending and improving
Thread & Matter support for Home Assistant.

A couple of weeks ago, we've published [an extensive blog article on where we're at](/blog/2023/02/08/state-of-matter-and-thread/)
right now. Some of the features mentioned in that blog post, will become
available today in this release.

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/219357671-6f51aeb0-2b64-43a7-92fb-d1a804164ae9.png' alt='Temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.'></a>
Note: This is a temporary placeholder screenshot. Needs replacement.
</p>

Matter now has support for connecting to Matter bridges, and [@ArturoGuerra]
add support light colors!

[@ArturoGuerra]: https://github.com/ArturoGuerra

## Python 3.11 support

Support for Python 3.11 is here! üêç

This change is only interesting if you manually run Home Assistant
directly in Python (aka the Home Assistant Core installation method). If that
is the case, you can now start using Home Assistant using Python 3.11, which
should dramatically improve performance over previous Python versions.

We are working on upgrading to Python 3.11 for our Home Assistant OS,
Supervised, and Container installation methods as well so we can provide
the same performance improvements. We'll keep you posted.

## Other noteworthy changes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Last minute ones added?
- Go over list again, might have missed something
- Ability to hide the legend of history graphs

To consider:
- The speedup on setting up MQTT are pretty massive
  - Make mqtt discovery use callback functions ([@bdraco] - [#87883]) ([mqtt docs]) (noteworthy)
  - Optimize mqtt matchers ([@bdraco] - [#87853]) ([mqtt docs]) (noteworthy)
  - Avoid creating a task when waiting for the MQTT mid ([@bdraco] - [#87887]) ([mqtt docs]) (noteworthy)
- Optimize fetching weekly/monthly/yearly statistics ([@bdraco] - [#87747]) ([recorder docs]) (noteworthy)
- Optionally update sensor units when unit system is changed ([@emontnemery] - [#83851]) ([config docs]) ([sensor docs]) (noteworthy)

**Note**: Changes processed up to PR 88451

{% enddetails %}

There is much more juice in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

## Breaking Changes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar

**Note**: Breaking changes processed up to PR 86100

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Assist / Conversation" %}

Previously, all entities and areas were exposed to Assist's default agent. This
is now restricted to entities of the following domains:

- `climate`
- `cover`
- `fan`
- `humidifier`
- `light`
- `lock`
- `scene`
- `script`
- `sensor`
- `switch`
- `vacuum`

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

The behavior for receiving values on sensors that expect numeric* values
has changed.

- From now on a `'None'` value or a value rendered to `'None'` will
  set such a sensor to an `unknown` state.
- Empty values on such sensors (`''`) are ignored and will not affect the state
  of the sensor.

Integrations need to be corrected to send the correct values if an update is
published and no valid update value is available for the sensor.

- Other sensors that do not expect a numeric value will still accept
  an empty string as a value.

\* Sensors expect numeric values if at least one of the following applies:
- A `device_class` is set but is not a `date`, `timestamp`, `enum`, or any custom device class.
- A `state_class` is set.
- A `unit_of_measurement` is set.
- A `suggested_display_precision` is set.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Profiler" %}

The `profiler.memory` service is not available when using Python 3.11, due to
an incompatibility with a needed dependency for this service. It will return if
and when the used `guppy3` package becomes available with Python 3.11 compatibility.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Template: Covers" %}

Template covers using `optimistic: false` without `value_template` nor
`position_template` was having a managed state. If you want to keep the
previous behavior, you must set `optimistic` value to `true`,
or remove the optimistic declaration.

{% details "Trafikverket Weather" %}

The unit of measurement and device class has been incorrectly set to `mm` while the
API is returning `mm/h`. This has now been corrected.

{% details "UniFi Protect" %}

The `event_id` and `event_score` state attributes are now excluded from being
recorded in the database. They remain available for use in automations
and scripts.

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#88387]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/88387

---

The previously deprecated "Detected Object" sensor has been removed.

The sensor was removed because if multiple objects are detected at once
(very common for package detection) Home Assistant could not be automated
using the second detected object. The sensor has been split out the single
Detected Object sensor into multiple binary issues for each detection type.
