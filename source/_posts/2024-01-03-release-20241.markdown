## Automation editor improvements

The automation editor got some love this release, with a lot of small
improvements to make it easier to use.

If you start out with Home Assistant, visiting your automations page would
result in an empty page. This is not very helpful if you see this for the first
time.

Instead, you are now greeted by the little automation robot that shows
an explanation of what automations are, and references to the documentation
that can help you get started.

_TODO: Add screenshot_

Once you start create a new integration, you will be greeted by some new
terminology and description to help you understand what each section is about.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/291381465-0766c064-d787-41e6-8349-0b56193ee526.png' alt='Temporary images that needs to be replaced.'>

Don't worry, we'll hide the help text once you added elements to the section.
The bigger change can be found in the buttons to add a trigger, condition or
action to your automation.

The first thing to notice, is that the conditions and actions have a new
button next to them: "Add building block". Click this allows you to 
add logical elements to your automation, like "and", "or", "If", "choose", etc.

These used to be mixed in with the conditions and actions, but now have their
own dedicated button. This makes it easier to find them, and declutters the
list of conditions and actions.

_TODO: Add screenshot_

All these buttons, used to give a dropdown that allowed you to select the
type of trigger, condition or action you wanted to add. This dropdown has
been replaced by a new dialog, including descriptions for each item and search.

These descriptions are important, as they help you understand what the
trigger, condition or action does, and what it is used for.

_TODO: Add screenshot_

If you add an element, we will show you the most commonly used
trigger/condition/action first. All others are neatly categorized in the
other sections.

Last, but not least, the "service calls" are now merged with all other actions.
Meaning, that if you add an action, you see all actions, including service
calls. They are neatly grouped by entity type and the integration providing them,
provide the descriptions on what they do, and are searchable as well.

_TODO: Add screenshot_

## Description & due support for todo list items

This feature was already hinted in the last release, but now it is here!

You can add due dates and description to each item in your todo list (if
supported by the integration of course).

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/292194204-990069b1-e517-4b93-9190-c2beeb7f782a.png' alt='Temporary images that needs to be replaced.'>

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/292194141-1081eba6-9914-4f79-9d93-414b9fae91bd.png' alt='Temporary images that needs to be replaced.'>

## New entity type: Valve

A brand new entity type has been added to Home Assistant: Valve!

This entity type can be used by integrations to expose valves, like for example
a valve on a radiator, pool or sprinkler system.

_TODO: Add screenshot_

Currently, the Shelly integration supports it and now provides an `valve` entity
for the Valve addon for Shelly Gas. Additionally, support for it has been
added to MQTT, and the valve entities also work with Amazon Alexa
and Google Assistant.

## Swappable current/target on thermostat & humidifier cards

By popular demand, the thermostat and humidifier cards now support setting 
current temperature/humidity as the primary information to show in the
card.

Enabling this option, will result in the target temperature/humidity to be
swapped.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/291251306-f8765c74-ccd0-410d-be4d-1f1c1b93ffa3.png' alt='Temporary images that needs to be replaced.'>

## New card features

Last year, we have seen many new features added to the cards, so let's start
the new year with some more!

@Quentame added the climate fan mode card feature feature. This feature can be
used with both the thermostat and the climate card.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14821482/291761102-2c5f60dd-5dfa-453e-ad5c-abd977601abd.png' alt='Temporary images that needs to be replaced.'>

Also new, the update actions card feature. This addition by @piitaya allows
you to add buttons to a card that can trigger update actions when pressed.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/292223971-249333f8-627c-4124-9336-0b6ce83355e0.png' alt='Temporary images that needs to be replaced.'>

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Home Assistant shutdown event" %}

The event key in the (undocumented) trigger data for the `homeassistant` trigger
platform is now the string `shutdown` for a `homeassistant` trigger configured
to fire on shutdown instead of an `Event` object.

[#91165]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91165

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Modbus" %}

Setting `swap: none` has been removed from the Modbus configuration,
it is identical to omitting it: `swap:`.

{% details "PrusaLink" %}

- The printer state now contains several new statuses, most importantly
  "attention" which always needs your invention.
- Firmware 4.7.0 is now the minimum version for Prusa XL and MK4.

{% details "Reolink" %}

The Reolink `Infra red lights in night mode` entity has been migrated from
the `light` to the `switch` domain.

This means the entity ID also changed and automations and dashboards may need
to be adjusted to use the new entity ID. 

If you want to go back to the light domain, use the
[switch_as_x "Show as" option](/integrations/switch_as_x/#change-device-type-of-a-switch-from-the-existing-entity)
on the new `Infra red lights in night mode` switch entity and select light.
