Happy New Year! üçæ

We wish you, and all the loved ones around you, all the best for 2024! ü•Ç

I cannot think of a better way to start the new year: Home Assistant Core 2024.1! üéâ

This release is fairly small, as expected; we are just coming out of the holiday
season. However, it does contain some nice improvements and
features to be excited about and a stunning total of 13 new integrations!

My favorite: the automation editor changes. It had quite a bunch of user
interface tweaks. Most are focused on making it friendlier and easier to use
for new and long-term users, making it quicker to find the right trigger,
condition, or action.

I greatly like this improved experience, and I hope you do too!

Enjoy the release!

## Automation editor improvements

The automation editor got some love for this release, with many small
improvements to make it easier for both new and long-time users.

As there are many small improvements, let‚Äôs go over them individually.

PS: One quick note: all changes are UI changes, meaning that these changes
do not affect the underlying automation configuration. All your existing
automations will continue to work as they did before.

### Improved empty automations dashboard

If you start with Home Assistant, visiting the automations dashboard would
result in an empty page. That is not very helpful if you see this for the
first time. So, we‚Äôve improved that!

You are now greeted by the little automation robot that explains what an
automation is and references to the documentation that can help you get started.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/start-automating.png' alt='Screenshot showing an empty automations dashboard, explaining what automations are.'>

A small but effective improvement to help new users get started. We have also
applied this same improvement to the scripts and scenes dashboards.

### Guidance when creating a new automation

When starting a new automation from scratch, you used to be greeted by some,
possibly, new terminology and almost a blank page with some buttons to
add triggers, conditions or actions. As a new user, this immediately imposes
a challenge: what do I need to do?

You guessed it: We have slightly improved that. We have changed the big headers
to be more descriptive and less technical. We have also added some help text to
explain each section, including examples of what they can be used for.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/automation-descriptions.png' alt='Screenshot showing descriptions on what each section in an automation is and can be used for.'>

Don‚Äôt worry; we‚Äôll hide the explanation once you add elements to the sections
to keep the overview of existing automations as clean as possible.

### Building blocks

You might have noticed in the screenshots above the conditions and actions have
a new button next to them: **+ Add building block**.

Selecting these new buttons allows you to add logical elements to your
automation or scripts, like **And**, **Or**, **If-then**, **Choose**, etc.

These used to be mixed in with the conditions and actions but now have their
own dedicated button. It makes it easier to find them and declutters the
list of conditions and actions.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/automation-building-blocks.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new dialog that allows you to add logical building blocks to automations.'>

Notice how this now opens up a dialog? A dialog gives us more space to describe
what each building block does and room for a search box to find the one you need.

### Improved trigger, condition & action buttons

The bigger change can be found in the buttons to add a trigger, conditions,
or actions to your automation. This change was not just aimed at new users
but also long-time users.

All these buttons are used to give a dropdown that allows you to select the
type of trigger, condition, or action you want to add. This dropdown has been
replaced by a new dialog similar to the one we just saw for the building blocks.

Like the building block, it describes what each trigger, condition,
or action does. These descriptions are important, as they help you understand
what they do.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/add-trigger-dialog.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new add trigger dialog, which displayed the most common triggers first.'>

If you add an element, we will first show you the most used
triggers/conditions/actions by our community. We now have all others neatly
grouped. For actions, we took it a step further and unified them with
service calls.

### Unified actions

If you have been using Home Assistant for a while, you are probably familiar
with the ‚Äúservice call‚Äù-action that you can add to your automation. But,
honestly, what is a ‚Äúservice call‚Äù? It is a bit of a technical term that is
especially confusing for newer users. You just want to turn on a light, right?

This release unifies those ‚Äúservice calls‚Äù with all other actions, meaning
there is no ‚Äúservice call‚Äù anymore; that layer has been refactored from the UI.
Instead, you add an action and select the action you want to take, for example,
turn on a light.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/add-light-action.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new add action dialog, which now shows all possible actions, including services.'>

This means that if you add an action, you see all actions (including all
service calls), categorized, with description, and searchable! Being able
to search through all available actions is a huge improvement.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-search.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new add action dialog utilizing the search function to find whatever you need.'>

By default, just like with the triggers and conditions, we show you the most
used actions first and the actions for the entities you have on your system.
All others are neatly grouped by integration in the **Other actions** section.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-other-integrations.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new add action dialog that neatly groups all other actions that integrations provide.'>

## Description & due date support for to-do list items

The to-do list integration keeps getting better and better. This release adds
support for descriptions and due dates!

If the integration you are using supports it, you can now add descriptions to
each task on your list. It fully supports the Markdown markup to add links,
bold text, etc. If due dates (or due date + time) are supported, you can
set these.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/todo-dialog.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new to-do item dialog, where you now can set a description and a URL.'>

As shown in the screenshot above, there is a whole new dialog to adjust
your to-do item. But this is not the only change. The list itself has been
improved as well.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/todo-new-dashboard.png' alt='Screenshot showing the improve to-do dashboard, showing descriptions and highlighting overdue items.'>

It is much cleaner, all big text boxes are gone, and each item is nicely
formatted, including an excerpt of the description and the due date. If the due
date is overdue, it will be highlighted.

## New entity type: Valve

A brand new entity type has been added to Home Assistant: Valve!

Integrations can use this entity type to expose valves, such as a valve on
a radiator, pool, sprinkler system, and main house gas or water line.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/valve-entity-type.png' alt='Screenshot showing a valve entity in the Home Assistant UI.'>

Currently, the [Shelly integration] supports it and now provides a `valve` entity
for the Valve addon for Shelly Gas. Additionally, support for it has been
added to [MQTT], and the valve entities also work with Amazon Alexa
and Google Assistant.

Tip: Do you have a switch entity that controls a valve? You can now change the
entity type to valve in the entity settings.

[MQTT]: integrations/valve.mqtt

## Swappable current/target on thermostat & humidifier cards

By popular demand, the thermostat and humidifier cards now support setting 
current temperature/humidity as the primary information to show on the
card.

You can enable the **show current temperature as primary information** option
in the card, which will result in the target temperature being swapped with the
current temperature in the card.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/climate-card-change-primary-temperature.png' alt='Screenshot showing two thermostat cards. One has the setpoint as a primary temperature, the other the current temperature.'>

## New card features

Last year, we saw many new features added to the cards, so let's start
the new year with some more!

[@Quentame] added the climate fan mode card feature. This feature can be
used with both the thermostat and the tile card:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-01/climate-fan-card-feature.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new fan mode card feature that can be used on the tile and thermostat cards.'>

Also new is the update actions card feature. This addition by [@piitaya] allows
you to add buttons to a card to trigger update actions when pressed.

- You can now configure the minimal number of samples the [trend] helper uses.
  It allows you to make it less sensitive when there is not that much data.
  Thanks, [@jpbede]!
- Got cold toes in bed? [@kbickar] to the rescue! He added support for
  foot warmers to the [SleepIQ] integration. Nice!

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Blink" %}

The service calls of Blink have been adjusted. This affects
`blink.trigger_camera`, `blink.save_video` and `blink.save_recent_clips`.

This change will require these service calls to be updated with a `target` for
the camera and by removing `name` from `data` of the blink service calls.

For example, service call before 2023.11:

```yaml
service: blink.save_video
data:
  name: Front door
  filename: test.mp4
``` 

Service call after 2023.11 and before 2024.1:

```yaml
service: blink.save_video
data:
  device_id: 87dc3b85c18ee84f8c322a95e8230eb2
  name: Front door
  filename: test.mp4
``` 

New service call:
```yaml
service: blink.save_video
target:
  entity_id:
    - camera.front_door
data:
  filename: test.mp4
``` 

---

The `blink.send_pin` service now uses an integration/configuration entry selector:

Example service call before 2023.11:

```yaml
service: blink.send_pin
data:
  pin: "1234"
```

Service call after 2023.11 and before 2024.1:

```yaml
service: blink.send_pin
data:
  pin: "1234"
  device_id: 87dc3b85c18ee84f8c322a95e8230eb2
```

 New service call:

```yaml
service: blink.send_pin
data:
  config_entry_id: a1bee602deade2b09bc522749bbce48e
  pin: "1234"
```

---

The `blink.blink_update` service is deprecated and will be removed in 2024.7.0.
Use the `homeassistant.update_entity` service instead.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Home Assistant shutdown event" %}

The event key in the (undocumented) trigger data for the `homeassistant` trigger
platform is now the string `shutdown` for a `homeassistant` trigger configured
to fire on shutdown instead of an `Event` object.

{% details "Modbus" %}

Setting `swap: none` has been removed from the Modbus configuration.
It is identical to omitting it: `swap:`.

{% details "PrusaLink" %}

- The printer state now contains several new statuses, most importantly
  "attention", which always needs your intervention.
- Firmware 4.7.0 is now the minimum version for Prusa XL and MK4.
- Firmware 5.1.0 is now the minimum version for Prusa Mini since 4.7.x and 5.0.x
  aren't available for the Mini.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Reolink" %}

The Reolink `Infrared lights in night mode` entity has been migrated from
the `light` to the `switch` domain.

This means the entity ID also changed, and automations and dashboards may need
to be adjusted to use the new entity ID. 

If you want to go back to the light domain, use the
[switch_as_x "Show as" option](/integrations/switch_as_x/#change-device-type-of-a-switch-from-the-existing-entity)
on the new `Infrared lights in night mode` switch entity and select light.

{% details "Shelly" %}

The minimum supported firmware version for generation 1 devices is 1.11.0 (2021-07-15).
The minimum supported firmware version for generation 2 devices is 1.0.0 (2023-08-03).

You must update your devices to the firmware versions listed or newer.
