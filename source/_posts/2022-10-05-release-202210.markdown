## Integrations v2

(Working title, need to be changed to something useful)

{% details "TODO" %}

- Needs a better title
- Improve story
- Screenshots
- Spelling/grammar
- https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/13887

{% enddetails %}

Recently we introduced "Supported brands" in Home Assistant, this release
is taking that concept a step further to improve the experience in adding
new devices or services to Home Assistant.

For some brands of devices, we have actually multiple integrations available.
For example, some devices can work via Zigbee (e.g, ZHA) but also via their
matching Hub (e.g., Hue bridge). Other might work locally via HomeKit or
Bluetooh, or by using their cloud using a different integration.

To make it more clear on the choices available, you can now add integration
by brand. Home Assistant will show the options available for that specific
brand.

This way, you no longer have to "find out" how your device could be integrated.

## Active connections for Bluetooth remote proxies

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve story
- Needs a better title
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

Support for active Bluetooth connections via Bluetooth proxies in ESPHome
has been added.

**At the time of reading this, we are in beta**, the ESPHome part is not yet
available. So this feature is coming, we are working on making all
parts available asap.

## Sub-views for dashboards

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve story
- Needs a better title
- Screenshots
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

Dashboard views now can be marked as "Subview".

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/191509109-68d10563-739c-4dd0-91af-b209ca303059.png'>
Temporary image, which needs to be replaced.
</p>

Subviews won't show up in the navigation bar, but can be linked to,
from e.g., a button. Subviews only show a back button. Here is an
example of a subview in a short movie clip (need replacement):

<video controls="controls">
<source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/191218073-b3ba3bff-c75d-4544-bec9-3417b7941ddc.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Restyling of all dialogs

{% details "TODO" %}

- Probably can be moved to the other noteworthy
- Add an actual story
- Needs a better title
- Screenshots (before after?)
- What is next?
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

All dialogs that are shown in the Home Assistant UI have been slightly updated.
They now have a more consistent look and contents (in terms of action buttons &
icons) and are styled closer towards the Material Design v3 styling.

## Viewing manual automations in the automation editor

{% details "TODO" %}

- Add an actual story
- Needs a better title
- Screenshots
- Spelling/grammar
- Allow fetching automation config ([@balloob] - [#79130]) ([automation docs])
- Allow fetching script config ([@balloob] - [#79131]) ([script docs])
- WIP: https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/13900

{% enddetails %}

In the last release, we revamped our automation editor and we are very
happy to read how many of you loved these changes ❤️

However, if you manage your automations manually in YAML you'd always be
served an error message when trying to open an automation in the UI.

This has been improved! You can now open any automation (or script) in the UI,
allowing you to view your automation, giving a quick glance and their
workings.

Besides, as an additional bonus, if you have considered moving your automation
to the UI, you can now actually view and experience how it would look/work
for those automations.

## New template thingies

{% details "TODO" %}

- Consider moving to noteworthy
- Needs a better title
- Needs link to documentation
- Improve on story
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

A new `version()` template function/filter has been added that allows
you to do awesome things with version numbers.

It allows for getting information about a number, comparing version
numbers and even check the difference between 2 version numbers.

{% raw %}

- `{{ version("2022.10.0") > "2022.9.7" }}`  Will return true, as `2022.10.0` is newer.
- `{{ (version("2022.10.1") - "2022.10.0").patch }}` Will return true, as the patch number of the version changed.
- `{{ (version("2022.10.1") - "2022.10.0").minor }}` Will return false, as there is just a patch difference.
- `{{ version("2022.10.0b0").beta }}` will return true, as this is a beta version.

{% endraw %}

## Google sheets

Nice new integration, consider doing a section about it (TODO).


## iBeacon

Nice new integration, consider doing a section about it (TODO).

## Other noteworthy changes

## Breaking Changes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar

**Note**: Breaking changes processed up to PR 78832

{% enddetails %}

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Bayesian" %}

The `prob_given_false` configuration variable, is now a required configuration
variable as there was no mathematical rationale for the previous default value.

`numeric_state`, `template`, and `state` entries with only one `to_state`
configured will also now update the prior probability accordingly if the
observation is false. Those who have used duplicate, mirrored `state`
configurations as a work-around will have their functionality preserved.
However for `numeric_state` and `template` entries this will cause duplication
of the Bayesian updating.

([@HarvsG] - [#67631]) ([documentation](/integrations/bayesian))

[@HarvsG]: https://github.com/HarvsG
[#67631]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/67631

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Bluesound" %}

When the player is grouped and isn't master, the state no longer reports as
"grouped" but instead reports as "idle".

([@epenet] - [#78096]) ([documentation](/integrations/bluesound))

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#78096]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/78096

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Elexa Guardian" %}

The previously deprecated `guardian.reboot` and
`guardian.reset_valve_diagnostics` services have been removed and replaced
by button entities on the guardian valve controller device.

([@bachya] - [#78663]) ([documentation](/integrations/guardian))

[@bachya]: https://github.com/bachya
[#78663]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/78663

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Frontier Silicon" %}

When the player is loading, the state no longer reports as "opening",
but instead reports as "buffering".

([@epenet] - [#78101]) ([documentation](/integrations/frontier_silicon))

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#78101]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/78101

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HERE Travel Time" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the HERE Travel Time
integration has been removed.

HERE Travel Time is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files

([@eifinger] - [#77959]) ([documentation](/integrations/here_travel_time))

[@eifinger]: https://github.com/eifinger
[#77959]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/77959

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit Controller" %}

When the player is not active, the state no longer reports as "problem",
but instead reports as "off".

When the player is active, but the state doesn't match known states,
the state no longer reports as "ok" but instead reports as "on".

([@epenet] - [#78105]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit_controller))

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#78105]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/78105

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Radarr" %}

Some breaking changes has been made in disabling the Movies count sensor out
of caution. This sensor can cause problems with massive databases.
If the you still wish to use it, you may do so.

Movie names are no longer included as attributes in the movies sensor. Upcoming
has been removed. It is being modernized as calendar items should be.
Diskspace is now split into different sensors, one for each folder.
Status and commands have been removed as they don't appear to have real
value for automations.

([@tkdrob] - [#78965]) ([documentation](/integrations/radarr))

[@tkdrob]: https://github.com/tkdrob
[#78965]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/78965

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Supervisor" %}

In Home Assistant 2022.4 the binary sensors for showing an update from the
Supervisor integration were deprecated in favor of
[update entities](/integrations/hassio/#update-entities).

These binary sensors for showing an update now have been removed.

([@ludeeus] - [#60677]) ([documentation](/integrations/hassio))

[@ludeeus]: https://github.com/ludeeus
[#60677]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/60677

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Workday" %}

Due to changes in the upstream library, the following is no longer supported by
the Workday integration:
- UK subdivisions (Wales, Scotland, England...) can no longer be provided as
  values to `country` configuration key, they are still available for use as
  values to the `province` setting.
- `IsleOfMan` if no longer a recognised province of the UK,
  use the `IM` code for `country` instead.
- The extended Portuguese holiday set (`PortugalExt`) is no longer available
  as a separate country, instead you should use the country code `PT` and
  the province `Ext`.

([@TomBrien] - [#78832]) ([documentation](/integrations/workday))

[@TomBrien]: https://github.com/TomBrien
[#78832]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/78832

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

The fan speed levels of Leviton ZW4SF fan controllers are now mapped correctly
to corresponding percentage levels in Home Assistant.

This may change which fan speed is selected at certain percentages.
You should adjust any automations and scripts that target these devices
as needed.

([@mkowalchuk] - [#60677]) ([documentation](/integrations/zwave_js))

[@mkowalchuk]: https://github.com/mkowalchuk
[#60677]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/60677
