Happy New Year! üçæ

We wish you, and all the loved ones around you, all the best for 2023! ü•Ç

2023: What an exciting year this will be; [The year of the voice](/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/)!
And not just that, many exciting things are expected this year. More spoilers
can be found in the [State of the Open Home 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D936T1Ze8-4)
recording on YouTube.

Starting this amazing year with: Home Assistant Core 2023.1! üéä

A fairly small release, as we all enjoyed our Holidays. Yet, the first traces
of the voice project is already visible: support for entity aliases!

Still, this release contains over 500 changes, most of which are
quality improvements, bug and stability fixes, and other minor improvements.
The perfect release to start the year with, an easy upgrade worth doing.

Enjoy the release!

../Frenck

PS: Did you know [Home Assistant is now on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@homeassistant) too?

## The year of the voice!

{% details "TODO" %}

- Add story
- Link to year of the voice blog announcement
- Add links to the intents repositories and ask for help
- Update intent response ([@synesthesiam] - [#83560]) ([conversation docs]) ([intent docs]) ([almond docs])
- Update intent response ([@synesthesiam] - [#83858]) ([conversation docs]) ([intent docs])

{% enddetails %}

This is the year of the voice. This section needs some content.

Announcement blog: [2023: Home Assistant's year of Voice](/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/)

Repository to contribute: [Intents for Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/intents)

## Aliases for voice assistants

{% details "TODO" %}

- Expand story
- Replace screenshot
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

Aliases for entity names are now configurable via the UI. Aliases are currently
used by Google Assistant and was previously only available for use in YAML.
This can, of course, later be used by our own Home Assistant voice assistant
as well.

These aliases are helpful in case you call the same device by multiple names,
or, when using a voice assistant in multiple languages at the same time.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/209155967-e5b55145-c6b0-4e17-a7c8-d90725175518.png' alt='Lorem ipsum'>
Note: Placeholder screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

The aliases configuration can be found on each entity dialog, in the advanced
settings section. It does require that entities are managable via the UI.

## Matter updates

{% details "TODO" %}

- Add story/content/research
- Add screenshot Android app?
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

Some updates on Matter in Home Assistant.

The Android app with support for pairing Matter devices has been
released.

Decomissioning of matter devices have been added/fixed.

## Calendar updates

{% details "TODO" %}

- Change title?
- Add more story?
- A screenshot would most certainly be nice :)
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

Last release introduced the local calendar, which included the capbility to
manage calendar events from Home Assistant. These features now have been 
added to the Google Calendar integration as well!

This means you can now create a new event in your Google Calendar, straight
from within Home Assistant. Neat!

Also, support formonthly variations for recurrence rules have been added, which
includes things like:

- On the 20st day of the month
- On the 3rd Wednesday
- On the last Tuesday

The local calendar has been extended to provide editing support for existing
event now too ü§ò

## Translation & automation editor improvements for entity attributes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Better title
- Better story
- Spelling/grammar
- Add `translation_key` property to entites ([@emontnemery] - [#82701]) ([recorder docs]) ([accuweather docs])
- Add enum device_class and state options property to sensor entities ([@frenck] - [#82489]) ([demo docs]) ([sensor docs])
- Add support for translating custom attribute state ([@emontnemery] - [#83386]) ([demo docs])
- Add support for translating state attributes ([@emontnemery] - [#77028]) ([climate docs])

{% enddetails %}

This release is adding small improvements to the handling of entity attributes.

Some entities provide additional properties, for example, climate entities
provide presets. Or sensor entities provide a textual state from a fixed set of
possible states.

This release adds the possibility to our Home Assistant Core for sensor entities
to provide all possible state for such sensors, and more importantly, it provides
the capability for integrations to provide translations for those values!

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/195327/203090437-3756a83b-b30a-471f-baf7-e949a5a649a5.png' alt='Lorem ipsum'>
Note: Placeholder screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

These things greatly improve the UI experience, especially in the automations
and scripts editors. Those will now be able to provide more, and localized,
suggestions directly from the UI.

## Other noteworthy changes

There is much more juice in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- [@epenet] added a bunch of new device classes for sensors! We now have support
  for data size, data rate, irradiance, sound pressure, and atmospheric pressure.
- The [Shelly] integration now supports the Shelly Plus WallDimmer US,
  thanks [@thecode]!
- Configuration errors of automations and scripts with device automations have
  been significantly improved, providing you with much more details to help
  you fix the problem. Thanks, [@emontnemery]! 
- [@AngellusMortis] added a text entity to the [UniFi Protect], so you can now
  set the message displayed on your doorbell. Awesome!
- [Google Translate] has been extended with dialect support, thanks [@toddejohnson]!
- [Yale Access Bluetooth] now has support for battery status, thanks [@bdraco]!
- Three nice new additions to [SwitchBot], [@konikoni428] added support for power
  monitor of wallplugs, [@bdraco] added initial humidifier support, and
  [@dsypniewski] added support for SwitchBot locks! Awesome!
- [@FuzzyMistborn], added support for [ecobee] Smart Enhanced thermostats,
  thank you!

  Thanks, [@farmio]!

## Breaking Changes

{% details "Image Upload / Default Config" %}

The `image` integration domain was renamed to `image_upload`.

This change would only affect you when you have removed the
[`default_config`](/integrations/default_config) from your configuration.
In that case, you need to manually adjust your configuration to rename `image`
to `image_upload`.

The rename was done to free up the `image` domain for future use.

([@frenck] - [#84063]) ([documentation](/integrations/image_upload))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#84063]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/84063

{% enddetails %}

{% details "air-Q" %}

The unit for noise has been adjusted from `dBa` to `dBA`.

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#83581]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/83581

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AirVisual (Pro)" %}

AirVisual Pro units now have their own Home Assistant integration (as opposed
to be included with the original AirVisual integration that uses the AirVisual
cloud API).

Pro devices will automatically be migrated; as part of that migration,
the Pro's device ID will change.

If you utilize entity IDs belonging to a Pro in automations or scripts, you
don't need to do anything; if, however, you utilize a Pro's device ID,
please update those automations or scripts accordingly.

[#83882]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/83882

{% enddetails %}

{% details "APC UPS Daemon" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the APC UPS Daemon integration
has been removed.

APC UPS Daemon is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML configuration
has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely removed from your
YAML configuration files.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "deCONZ" %}

An issue with the mapping of triggers of Styrbar has been discovered and fixed.
As a result, any automations relying on these triggers will need to be
manually adjusted/re-configured to adjust to this change.

update it at your own custom schedule.
