Hey Everyone! Today we are announcing our new program called the Home Assistant Creator Network! We are super excited to
start talking closely with creators to ensure everyone has the best information possible. We are looking to invest in our
community and support the effort being put into keeping our users informed. This is a way for Home Assistant to reward these
creators that are positively engaging with our users.

## What is the Creator Network?

The creator network will be a group of creators that are active and engaged with our community with consistent content that
builds the archive for Home Assistant. These creators are creating content for YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc.
with the goal of helping people with Home Assistant. This can be through tutorials, unbiased product reviews, creating cool stuff and more.

We are looking forward to growing this network to be a great group of people that work together and share the best information.
One of the biggest ways we are doing that is monthly calls with the network to discuss release notes. This way all creators in the network
know exactly what was added so they can share it with their audience.
