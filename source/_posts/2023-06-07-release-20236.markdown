## Connect and use your existing network storage

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Refs:

- Include share as mount usage option (#16636) @ludeeus
- Add dialog to change default backup location (#16610) @ludeeus
- Add UI for network mounts (#16357) @ludeeus

{% enddetails %}

Do you have a network storage in your home? Like a QNAP or Synology NAS?
This release add the ability to add and use that storage with Home Assistant!

In the {% my storage title="**Settings** > **Storage**" %} menu, you can now
find a whole new set of controls to connect to your storage and use it to,
for example, use as your network share as a media source in Home Assistant.

Even better... You can use it as a target for your backups, so that when
Home Assistant creates a backup for you, it will be "off-site".

## Light entity dialog improvements, with favorite colors

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Refs:

- Light more info enhancement (#16673) @piitaya
- Update more info light actions (#16512) @piitaya
- New color picker for HS and color temp (#16549) @piitaya
- Update default colors for more info light favorite colors (#16688) @piitaya
- Add button bar for light modes (#16683) @piitaya

{% enddetails %}

Recently we introduced new controls in the light entity dialog, this release
iterates on the design by adding new controls and adding favorite colors.

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/242213802-301417be-65a5-40b3-aa32-25c3811e9e46.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

The favorite colors can be added and re-organized by holding one of the colors
to enter the edit mode:

## Integration pages

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Refs:

- Overhaul Integrations page, add integration page (#16640) @bramkragten

{% enddetails %}

The integrations page had gotten a major overhaul this release!

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/241394494-56c2d763-423e-4bf2-8c85-8cb0d9a14920.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

Some things to notice in the above screenshot:

- Device base integrations, like ESPHome, are now combined in a single card that
  doesn't require scrolling anymore
- The failing integration entry for deCONZ in the above screenshot, no longer
  displays large error messages and thus does not stretch the layout.
- Custom integrations and integrations relying on the cloud, are now more
  visibly marked.

Selecting the cog icon on the integration card, will bring you to a brand new
integrations page, showing all information about integration:

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/241394598-88b1e856-c337-4ba1-adf4-23a290251131.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

In the above example, the ESPHome integration page, shows all integration
entries this integration has. This page provides all the options and information
that used to be "stuffed" into the integration card on the old integrations
dashboard.

## Copy 'n paste support in the automation and script editors

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Refs:

- Add cut / copy / paste support to automation & script editor (#16488) @karwosts
- https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/16488

{% enddetails %}

An amazing contribution by @karwosts this release, that adds cut, copy & paste
capabilities to the automation editor!

You can now copy and paste any trigger, condition, and action into different
places of your automation, and even past it into a different automation all
together!

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32912880/237117102-21fcc059-f959-4989-9079-1a158befb6b6.gif'></a>

## Related information

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Refs:

- Tweak style of related items (#16672) @bramkragten
- Related blueprints (#16618) @bramkragten

{% enddetails %}

Which automationed used that blueprint? Well, Home Assistant can now tell you
that! On the {% my blueprints title="**Settings** > **Automations & Scenes** > **Blueprints**" %}
page you can now hit the trippel dotted menu on any blueprint to discover which
automations are using that blueprint.

Now only that, if you accidentially remove a blueprint that is still in use,
Home Assistant will stop you from doing that and tell you which automations
still rely on it.

But wait, there is more related! The related items in the entity information
dialog got improved as well. Told old list of links is gone, and it now shows
a way more modern view of all related items for an entity:

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/242026603-be5cd16a-a321-4bae-b4a0-3b68feaf39a6.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

## Last changed added to the entity dialog

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Refs:

- Add last-changed date to more-info (#16509) @piitaya

{% enddetails %}

By popular request, the information on when an entity was last changed,
has been added back to into the new entity information dialogs.

Not only that, @piitaya added a very nice easter egg! You can click on it
to toggle between the relative and absolute format!

## Python 3.11 and major performance upgrades

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

This release ships running on Python 3.11! In case you are wondering, what is
that? Well, Python is the language the Core of Home Assistant is written in.

Why it matters? It is seriously faster! üöÄ

And that is not all in terms of performance, we've also upgraded internal parts,
including a newer SQLite version that should be faster. Oh! And of course
@bdraco has been all over the place to optimize a lot (a lot lot).

So this release, can be expected to be a lot faster (or less consuming) of
resources at runtime.

## Z-Wave

{% details "TODO" %}

- Make a story out of this
- Proof read/spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

There has been quite a bit of progress on Z-Wave in Home Assistant.

- Add entities for node statistics so that users can more easily troubleshoot RF issues in their network
- Add support for Window Covering CC which improves support for blind tilt devices (fixes iBlinds v3)
- Fix notification CC sensor and button names
- Proper Indicator CC support (certification requirement)
- Optimistic state updates for multilevel switch entities (specifically buttons and switches - certification requirement)
- Add entities for config parameters so they can be included in part of automations (they were already supported in device automations but entities will give users more flexibility)
- We added better support for z-wave devices related to energy generation

Z-Wave JS is now a platinum quality level integration üèÜ

## New entities! `date`, `time`, `date_time`

We welcome three new entities types this release:
[`date`](/integrations/date), [`time`](/integrations/time) & [`date_time`](/integrations/date_time).

These entities allow integration to provide for date, time, or date/time input
controls from the UI.

They are so new, that no integrations are using them yet, but you can expect
to see usage in (custom) integrations of these soon!

Thanks for creating those [@raman325]!

## Other noteworthy changes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Last minute ones added?
- Go over list again, might have missed something

## Breaking Changes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar

**Note**: Breaking changes processed up to PR 92223

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Python" %}

All Home Assistant versions of which the Home Assistant project manages the
Python version for you, have been upgraded to Python 3.11. This affects
the following installation types:

- Home Assistant Operating System
- Home Assistant Container
- Home Assistant Supervised

This might affect you when you are using custom integrations, as those have
to be compatible with Python 3.11.

Furthermore, as of this release, Python 3.10 is deprecated and support will
be removed in Home Assistant 2023.8. This **only** affects you if you are
running Home Assistant Core installation type in your own Python virtual
environment. Please update your Python version to Python 3.11.

If you run Home Assistant OS, Home Assistant Container or Home Assistant
Supervised, we have taken care of this for you, you will be using Python 3.11
automatically on upgrade.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "APC UPS Daemon" %}

`sensor.ups_self_test_interval` sensor now properly splits unit "days" from the
raw data. Previously, it will show `7 days` as sensor state, now it shows `7`
with a unit "Days".

([@yuxincs] - [#93844]) ([documentation](/integrations/apcupsd))

[@yuxincs]: https://github.com/yuxincs
[#93844]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/93844

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Counter" %}

The `counter` entities no longer restore their previous manually set
configuration (using the, now deprecated, `counter.configure` service) on
Home Assistant startup. Instead, it will now use the configuration as set in
the helper configuration in the UI (or as configured YAML, if that is used).

This behavior is removed, as it caused configuration issues, as the new
configuration was never applied again (but forever restored). This behavior was
out of the ordinary for Home Assistant and thus now standardized.

The value of the counter is still restored and available across Home Assistant
restarts.

([@frenck] - [#93344]) ([documentation](/integrations/counter))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#93344]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/93344

{% enddetails %}

{% details "D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plugs" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plugs
integration has been removed.

D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plugs are now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% details "EDL21" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the EDL21
integration has been removed.

EDL21 is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "EZVIZ" %}

The binary sensor providing "upgrade available" information, has been removed
and replaced by a new `update` entity. If you used the binary sensor in your
automations, scripts, or dashboards, you will need to adjust them to
this change.

integration has been removed.

Frontier Silicon is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

[#93552]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/93552

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Nest" %}

The Google Nest YAML configuration has been fully removed. You should ensure you
have imported your configuration and credentials into the UI before upgrading.

Nest Desktop or OOB authentication, which was previously disabled by Google,
has now been removed.

([@allenporter] - [#92311]) ([documentation](/integrations/nest))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#92311]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92311

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IBM Watson TTS" %}

Home Assistant was still using the legacy Python pip package resolver, which
has been removed. Due to upstream package conflicts, the IBM Watson TTS
integration has been disabled.

The upstream project providing the libaries used, has been notified repeatedly
in, at least, the past two years; unfortunately, without response. We had no
other choice than disabling this integration.

([@frenck] - [#92124]) ([documentation](/integrations/watson_tts))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#91492]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92124

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IHC Controller" %}

The default unit of measurement for manually set up sensors from IHC have been
removed. Home assistant now assume all sensors with unit of measurement set is
a number. IHC sensors can be text, but because of the default unit of
measurement, there is currently no way to get text sensors from IHC working.

This is a breaking fix, because if you currently have temperature sensors
without unit of measurement set, you will have to set this for the sensors.

{% details "LG Netcast" %}

LG Netcast media player do no longer have fake (assumed) `playing` or `paused`
states and those are replaced with the `on` state.

If you used the `playing` or `paused` state in your automations, you will need
to update them to match this change.

{% details "Meteorologisk institutt (Met.no)" %}

The weather forecast provided by the weather entity has changes. The current
day has been added to the forecast. If your automation or scripts relied
on the first day to be tomorrow, you will need to adjust.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

MQTT sensor configurations that still use `last_reset_topic` will fail. The
support was deprecated in Home Assistant 2021.11 and is now removed. Users
should use ` last_reset_value_template` instead.

{% details "Salda Smarty" %}

Home Assistant was still using the legacy Python pip package resolver, which
has been removed. Due to upstream package conflicts, the Salda Smarty
integration has been disabled.

The upstream project providing the libaries used, has been notified repeatedly
in, at least, the past two years; unfortunately, without response. We had no
other choice than disabling this integration.

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

On/Off properties for the Indicator CC are no longer discovered as entities.

They were previously discovered as sensor entities which were not useful in
cases where you wanted to change these values, and you would need to change
the value for all three On/Off properties simultaneously in order for them to
work, which wasn't supported with our existing discovery model.
