Home Assistant Core 2023.6! üéâ

Get ready for a classic, old-fashioned, jam-packed release! ü§Ø

I am excited about so many things being shipped in this release that it is
hard to pick a favorite üòÖ This release has it all.

Being able to directly use and back up my Home Assistant configuration to my
network storage is absolutely incredible! But I also really enjoy the new and
clean integrations dashboard and pages.

The feature that greatly improved the Home Approval Factor in my household
is definitely the addition of the new favorite colors in the light dialogs üé®

Enjoy the release!

## Connect and use your existing network storage

Do you have a network storage in your home? Like a QNAP or Synology NAS?
This release adds the ability to add and use that storage with Home Assistant!

This long and highly requested feature is now available when running the
Home Assistant Operating System. In the {% my storage title="**Settings** > **System** > **Storage**" %}
menu, you can now find a whole new set of controls to connect to your storage
and use it to, for example, use your network share as a media source
in Home Assistant.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/network-storage.png' alt='Screenshot showing two external network storages attached to Home Assistant.'>

Even better: You can use it as a target for your backups so that when
Home Assistant creates a backup for you, it will store it directly on
your network storage.

Multiple network storages are also supported; if you like, you can
easily add more.

## Integrations dashboard & pages

The integrations dashboard has gotten a major overhaul!

There have been quite some usability issues with the previous version of the
integration dashboard. For example, if you use [ESPHome] with many devices,
you are undoubtedly familiar with the annoying scrolling in that little card. Or,
big error messages stretching those cards out, messing up the whole page.

This release brings in a whole new integrations dashboard that addresses many
of these issues, aiming to provide a cleaner and more consistent experience.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/integrations-dashboard.png' alt='Screenshot showing the look and feel of the new integrations dashboard.'>

Device based integrations, like ESPHome, are combined: no more scrolling.
A failing integration no longer stretches the layout or makes the
layout "jump" during retries. Custom integrations and integrations relying
on the cloud are now more visibly marked.

Selecting the cog icon on the integration card will bring you to a brand new
integrations page, showing all information about the integration:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/integration-page.png' alt='Screenshot showing an integration page, in this case, the integration page of ESPHome.'>

In the above example, the ESPHome integration page shows all devices
this integration has. All the information and options, previously squashed into
the integration dashboard, are now available here.

These brand new integration pages are helpful in other places in Home Assistant.
For example, the device pages can now link back directly to the integration
that provided it.

## Light entity dialog improvements: favorite colors

Recently we introduced new controls in the light entity dialog, and this release
iterates on the design by adding the current brightness, new controls,
and adding favorite colors! üé®

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/light-dialog-favorite-colors.png' alt='Screenshot showing the improved light entity dialog, with the new favorite colors.'>

Each light (or light group) has its own set of colors. These colors can
be added, changed, removed, and reorganized using drag-and-drop. To enter
edit mode, select and hold one of the colors:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/edit-favorite-colors.gif' alt='Screen recording demonstrating editing favorite colors.'>

## Added to the entity dialog: last changed

By popular request, the information on when an entity was last changed has
been added back to the new entity information dialogs.

Not only that, [@piitaya] added a very nice easter egg! You can click on it
to toggle between the relative and absolute format!

<center><img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/toggle-last-changed.gif' alt='Screen recording demonstrating how to toggle between relative and absolute time.'></center>

## Related information

Which automation is using that blueprint? Well, Home Assistant can now tell you
that! On the {% my blueprints title="**Settings** > **Automations & Scenes** > **Blueprints**" %}
page, select the three dotted menu on any blueprint to discover which
automations are using that blueprint.

Not only that, if you accidentally try to remove a blueprint that is still in use,
Home Assistant will stop you from removing it and tell you which automations
still rely on it.

Hold on; there is more related! The related items in the entity information
dialog were improved as well. The old list of links is gone, and it now shows
a way more modern view of all related items for an entity:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/related-information.png' alt='Screenshot of the improved related entity information dialog.'>

Notice how it nicely links back to the new integration page here too!

## Copy 'n paste support in the automation editor

An amazing contribution by [@karwosts] in this release that adds cut, copy
& paste capabilities to the automation and script editors!

You can now copy and paste any trigger, condition, and action into different
places of your automation and even paste it into a different automation
altogether!

## Python 3.11 and significant performance upgrades

This release ships running on Python 3.11! In case you are wondering, what is
that? Well, Python is the language the Core of Home Assistant is written in.

Why it matters? It is seriously faster! üöÄ

If you run the Home Assistant Operating System or are using the Home Assistant
Container installation type: You won't have to do anything as we handle the
upgrade to Python 3.11 for you.

And that is not all in terms of performance. We've also upgraded internal parts,
including a newer SQLite version that should be faster. Oh! And, of course,
[@bdraco] has been all over the place to optimize a lot (a lot lot).

This release can be expected to be a lot faster (or less consuming) of resources
at runtime.

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco

## Matter 1.1

The Matter implementation within Home Assistant is now based on the freshly
released 1.1 version of the Matter standard. This brings a ton of stability
fixes and improvements, but unfortunately, no new features.

Thanks to [@Diegorro98], we do now have support for tilt covers! Besides that,
this Home Assistant release ships with several generic bugfixes and
optimizations; we've managed to squeeze out some additional performance to
make state updates for your Matter devices lightning-fast üöÄ

All these stability improvements to both the Matter stack and our
implementation did not go unnoticed:

<lite-youtube videoid="PsNdR-m5pwE" videotitle="This ACTUALLY Works Now!?"></lite-youtube>

## Z-Wave updates

There has been quite a bit of progress on Z-Wave in Home Assistant.

Thanks to [@raman325], the integration reached platinum level üèÜ on our
[quality scale]. This means the integration now does things right according
to best practices which should mean a better user experience in general.

Have you ever turned on a Z-Wave light from the Home Assistant UI just to see
the toggle going off again after a couple of seconds, then after some more
seconds seeing it going back to on? This long-standing issue (that even got the
nickname flip/flop) for certain devices, that are slow to respond to their
state has finally been addressed.

For those of you that like to automate everything, you can now automate not
only the Z-Wave device state but also the device configuration. We added device
configuration parameter entities so that almost every Z-Wave device setting
is now available as an entity.

Not stopping there, we also added entities for device connection statistics,
which you can use to, for example, create a notification if a device generates
more than a certain amount of dropped messages. If you want to track
a misbehaving device, you can enable these sensors to view the history
of the connection performance.

In the background, [@AlCalzone] is working tirelessly on the [Z-Wave JS driver],
which is the foundation of our Z-Wave integration. Among other things, some
devices are now faster to interview during addition, and more devices
can be configured.

## New entities! Date, time, date/time

We welcome three new entity types in this release:
[`date`](/integrations/date), [`time`](/integrations/time) & [`datetime`](/integrations/datetime).

These entities allow integrations to provide date, time, or date/time input
controls from the UI. They are very similar to the [input datetime](/integrations/input_datetime)
helper but are available for use by integrations.

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2023-06/new-date-time-entities.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new date & time entities introduced'></a>
How the new time, date, and date/time entities will look like on your dashboards.
</p>

They are so new that no integrations are using them yet, but you can expect
to see usage in (custom) integrations of these soon!

Thanks for creating those [@raman325]!

## Other noteworthy changes

There are much more easter bunnies in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- When using services in the UI (like in the automation editor), only options
  and settings available to the selected target devices & entities will be shown.
  This makes the UI much cleaner! Thanks, [@emontnemery] and [@bramkragten]!
- The [Roborock] integration (introduced in the previous release) received much
  love and now provides a wide range of new entities. Thanks [@Lash-L]!
- The [Android TV Remote] integration now provides a media player entity too!
  Nice, [@Drafteed]!
- [KNX] now provides its own panel, allowing you to upload your KNX
  project file, and offers a group monitor for live bus diagnostics.
  Information from the project is also used for device triggers.
  Amazing [@marvin-w] and [@farmio]!
- [@bdraco] added the option to disable Webhooks for [ONVIF] in case your
  camera isn't fully following specifications.
- The [variables action] is now also available in the automation and script
  editors in the UI. Thanks, [@piitaya]
- The add-on dashboard now has a search bar. Helpful, [@bramkragten]!
- The [Samsung TV] now has a remote entity, allowing you to send remote key
  presses directly to your TV! Thanks [@peitschie]!
- The {% my developer_states title="States in the developer tools" %} now
  uses the entity ID in the entity ID picker. Thanks, [@bramkragten]!
- [@gjohansson-ST] added a service to change a running timer helper, [@frenck]
  did something similar and added a service to set the value of a counter helper.
- The [AccuWeather] integration now provides sensors for the weather condition
  and solar irradiance values. Thanks, [@bieniu]
- You can now update your [QNAP QSW] directly from Home Assistant. Nice [@Noltari]!
- The [BMW Connected Drive] now allows you to toggle climate on/off and new
  entities related to the charging of your car. Thanks, [@rikroe] and [@cpoulsen]!

## Breaking Changes

{% details "Python" %}

All Home Assistant versions, of which the Home Assistant project manages the
Python version for you, have been upgraded to Python 3.11. This affects
the following installation types:

- Home Assistant Operating System
- Home Assistant Container
- Home Assistant Supervised

This might affect you when using custom integrations, as those must be
compatible with Python 3.11.

Furthermore, as of this release, Python 3.10 is deprecated, and support will
be removed in Home Assistant 2023.8. This **only** affects you if you are
running Home Assistant Core installation type in your own Python virtual
environment. Please update your Python version to Python 3.11.

If you run Home Assistant OS, Home Assistant Container, or Home Assistant
Supervised, we have taken care of this for you; you will be using Python 3.11
automatically on upgrade.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "APC UPS Daemon" %}

`sensor.ups_self_test_interval` sensor now properly splits unit "days" from the
raw data. Previously, it would show `7 days` as the sensor state.
Now it shows `7` with a unit "Days".

([@yuxincs] - [#93844]) ([documentation](/integrations/apcupsd))

[@yuxincs]: https://github.com/yuxincs
[#93844]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/93844

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Counter" %}

The `counter` entities no longer restore their previous manually set
configuration (using the - now deprecated - `counter.configure` service) on
Home Assistant startup. Instead, it will now use the configuration as set in
the helper configuration in the UI (or as configured YAML, if used).

This behavior is removed, as it caused configuration issues, as the new
configuration was never applied again (but forever restored). This behavior was
out of the ordinary for Home Assistant and thus now standardized.

The value of the counter is still restored and available across Home Assistant
restarts.

([@frenck] - [#93344]) ([documentation](/integrations/counter))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#93344]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/93344

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Command Line" %}

The Command Line integration changes its YAML configuration format from
an old-style platform configuration to a more modern integration-style
configuration format.

For example, if you have a binary sensor configured previously as:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: command_line
    command: "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
```

That same binary sensor is now configured under the `command_line` integration
configuration as:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
command_line:
  - binary_sensor:
      command: "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
```

Note: While this is currently not yet a breaking change, it did raise questions
during our beta testing period. Hence we have added this as a breaking change
to provide more context.

{% details "D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plugs" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plugs
integration has been removed.

D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plugs are now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% details "EDL21" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the EDL21
integration has been removed.

EDL21 is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "EZVIZ" %}

The binary sensor providing "upgrade available" information has been removed
and replaced by a new `update` entity. If you use the binary sensor in your
automations, scripts, or dashboards, you will need to adjust them to
this change.

integration has been removed.

Frontier Silicon is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Nest" %}

The Google Nest YAML configuration has been fully removed. You should ensure you
have imported your configuration and credentials into the UI before upgrading.

Nest Desktop or OOB authentication, which was previously disabled by Google,
has now been removed.

([@allenporter] - [#92311]) ([documentation](/integrations/nest))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#92311]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92311

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IBM Watson TTS" %}

Home Assistant was still using the legacy Python pip package resolver, which
has been removed. Due to upstream package conflicts, the IBM Watson TTS
integration has been disabled.

The upstream project providing the libraries used has been notified repeatedly
in, at least, the past two years; unfortunately, without response. We had no
other choice than to disable this integration.

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#91492]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92124

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IHC Controller" %}

The default unit of measurement for manually set up sensors from IHC has been
removed. Home Assistant now assumes all sensors with a unit of measurement set
are a number. IHC sensors can be text, but because of the default unit of
measurement, there is currently no way to get text sensors from IHC working.

This is a breaking fix because if you currently have temperature sensors
without a unit of measurement set, you will have to set this for the sensors.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "LG Netcast" %}

LG Netcast media players no longer have fake (assumed) `playing` or `paused`
states, and those are replaced with the `on` state.

If you used the `playing` or `paused` state in your automations, you will need
to update them to match this change.

{% details "Meteorologisk institutt (Met.no)" %}

The weather forecast provided by the weather entity has changed. The current
day has been added to the forecast. If your automations or scripts rely
on the first day to be tomorrow, you need to adjust them.

{% details "MQTT" %}

MQTT sensor configurations that still use `last_reset_topic` will fail. The
support was deprecated in Home Assistant 2021.11 and is now removed. Users
should use ` last_reset_value_template` instead.

{% details "Persistent notifications" %}

Persistent notifications are no longer stored in the state machine. This means
that we no longer create an entity for each persistent notification.

If you used these entities in, for example, automations, scripts, or templates,
you won't be able to use these anymore.

{% details "Salda Smarty" %}

Home Assistant was still using the legacy Python pip package resolver, which
has been removed. Due to upstream package conflicts, the Salda Smarty
integration has been disabled.

The upstream project providing the libraries used has been notified repeatedly
in, at least, the past two years; unfortunately, without response. We had no
other choice than to disable this integration.

{% details "Total Connect" %}

The tampered and low battery status zone attributes have been moved into their

scripts, or dashboards, you will need to update those to reflect this change.

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

On/Off properties for the Indicator CC are no longer discovered as entities.

They were previously discovered as sensor entities which were not useful in
cases where you wanted to change these values, and you would need to change
the value for all three On/Off properties simultaneously in order for them to
work, which wasn't supported with our existing discovery model.

For devices with the `Entry control` generic device class, the `Door lock mode`
config parameter no longer gets created as a `sensor` entity and will instead
get created as a `select` entity.

The Nice IBT4ZWAVE module was previously discovered as a light, but now it is
discovered as a cover. The light entity will be permanently unavailable and can
be safely deleted.
