The Home Assistant Conference is an online event to celebrate the community. Itâ€™s where the Home Assistant community will share their ideas, creations and major milestones. The event will take place on December 13, 2020.

The conference will contain three different tracks: everyone, advanced users and developers. For each track we have 5-6 speakers to share their creations, deep-dive into certain topics or share their epic automations.

Paulus Schoutsen, the founder of Home Assistant, will give the opening and closing keynote, aided by other Home Assistant developers.

After the talks, attendees will be able to attend various sessions about different topics like automations, lovelace and Q&A with Home Assistant developers.

## Attending

The Home Assistant Conference will be hosted on Hopin, an online conference platform. Tickets to attend will cost $1, which will cover the cost of the platform.
