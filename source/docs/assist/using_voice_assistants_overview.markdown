title: "Using voice assistants - overview"
---

We are in [chapter two](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/04/27/year-of-the-voice-chapter-2/) of Home Assistant's Year of the Voice.
We can now turn speech into text and text back into speech. Wake word detection is not yet supported.

The video below provides a good overview of what is currently possible with voice assistants. It shows you the following:

* How to voice-control devices using the Assist button, an [analog phone](/projects/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/), or an [ATOM Echo](/projects/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/).
* How to [expose devices to Assist](/docs/assist/voice_remote_expose_devices/). 
* How to set up a [local voice assistant](/docs/assist/voice_remote_local_assistant/). 
* The video also shows the differences in processing speed. It compares:
  * Home Assistant Cloud versus local processing,
  * local processing on more or less powerful hardware.
