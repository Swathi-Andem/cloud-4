The `Turn Touch` platform allows you to monitor your [Turn Touch](https://shop.turntouch.com/) battery level from within Home Assistant.

This sensor platform will be automatically configured if the Turn Touch component is configured.

For more configuration information see the [Turn Touch component](/components/turn_touch/) documentation.
