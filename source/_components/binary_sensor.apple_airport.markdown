This sensor will be intergrated into Home Assistant together with the [Apple Airport Device Tracker](/components/device_tracker.apple_airport/), no extra effort is needed.

It's a [HTTP binary sensor](/components/binary_sensor.http/), so everything about the HTTP binary sensor just applicable to this one.
