The `gearbest` sensor will track price of a product from [Gearbest](https://www.gearbest.com). This information can be used in e.g. automations to notify you when a price drops. The update interval for every item is currently set to 2 hours.

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: gearbest
    currency: EUR
    items:
      - url: https://www.gearbest.com/....
