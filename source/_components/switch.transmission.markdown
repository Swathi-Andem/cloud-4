The `transmission` switch platform allows you to control your [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) client from within Home Assistant. The platform enables you switch to your 'Alternative Speed Limits' (aka 'Turtle mode') setting. To get your Transmission switch working with Home Assistant, follow the instructions for the general [Transmission component](/components/transmission/).
