The `hive` climate platform integrates your Hive thermostat into Home Assistant, enabling control of setting the **mode** and setting the **target temperature**.

A short boost for Hive Heating can be set by using the **Boost** function, this will turn on the boost feature for Hive Heating for 30 minutes at 0.5 degrees higher than the current temperature.

The platform supports the following Hive products:

- Hive Active Heating
- Hive Multizone
