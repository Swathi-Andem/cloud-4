The `Mercedes me` component offers integration with the [Mercedes me](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/de/mercedes-me/) cloud service and provides presence detection as well as sensors such as doors, tires, windows, and service interval.

This component provides the following platforms:
 - Binary Sensors - such as windows, tires, doors, lock
 - Sensors - such as fuel status, service interval, remaining km...
 - Device tracker - to track location of your car
