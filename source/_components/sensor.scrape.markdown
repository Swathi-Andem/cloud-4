The `scrape` sensor platform is scraping information from websites. The sensor loads the body of a HTML page and gives you the option to search and split out a value. As this is not a full-blown web scraper like [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) it will most likely only works with simple webpage and it can be time-consuming to get the right section.

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: scrape
    resource: https://home-assistant.io
    filter: h1
```

Configuration variables:

- **resource** (*Required*): The URl to the website that contains the value.
- **filter** (*Required*): Defines the HTML tag to filter for, eg. `h1`, `span`, etc.
- **name** (*Optional*): Name of the sensor.
- **element** (*Optional*): Number of the element in the output.
- **before** (*Optional*): Count of chars to remove before the value.
- **after** (*Optional*): Count of chars to remove after the value.
- **unit_of_measurement** (*Optional*): Defines the units of measurement of the sensor, if any.
