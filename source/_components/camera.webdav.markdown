The WebDAV camera for Home Assistant allows you to create a camera that returns images from a WebDAV share.

The camera will display image files from the specified share in sorted order by filename, with each image 
being displayed for a user-defined interval. Non-image files are simply skipped over.

Specify the entity name, WebDAV server URL, and image interval in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: webdav
    name: file_server
    host: URL_OF_SHARE
    image_interval: '1:00'
```

Various authentication options are available (see table below), and you can also configure the camera to pull from
a specific path on the server rather than the root. Since this is a polling component, it is a good idea to
set the `scan_interval` to something other than the default.
