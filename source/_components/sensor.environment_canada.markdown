The `environment_canada` sensor platform uses [Environment Canada](https://weather.gc.ca/mainmenu/weather_menu_e.html) as a source for current meteorological data.

- The sensor automatically determines which weather station to use, according to this hierarchy:
  - Station code from sensor configuration
  - The closest station to latitude/longitude from sensor configuration
  - The closest station to latitude/longitude from Home Assistant core configuration

- One sensor entity is created for each monitored condition. Each sensor entity will be given the `device_id` of `ec_<optional-name>_<condition>`.
- A name is optional, but if multiple Environment Canada weather sensors are used a name can be used to distinguish them.
- The sensor checks for new data every 10 minutes, and the source data is typically updated hourly within 10 minutes after the hour.

To add Environment Canada sensors to your installation, add the desired lines from the following example to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: environment_canada
```

{% configuration %}
latitude:
  description: Part of a set of coordinates to use when finding the closest weather station.
