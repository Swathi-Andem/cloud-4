The `mclimate` water heater platform is consuming the information provided by a [mclimate bobbie](http://mclimate.eu/en/bobbie/meet-bobbie). This platform allows you to set vaction mode.
  
The water heater platform will be automatically configured if Melissa component is configured.

For more configuration information see the [Melissa component](/components/melissa/) documentation.
