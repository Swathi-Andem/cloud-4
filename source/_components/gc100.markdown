[gc100](https://www.globalcache.com/products/gc-100/) can be integrated into Home Assistant. gc100 is a TCP-controllable
hardware device which has an array of relays, RS232 serial ports, and flexible ports which can be programmed to be either digital inputs or IR blaster outputs. There are a variety of submodels of the gc100 which have different amounts of each I/O type.

Currently, only relays and ports configured to be digital inputs are supported in Home Assistant.

To enable this device, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
gc100:
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): The hostname/IP address of your GC100 device.
- **port** (*Required*): The port on which the GC100 is listening.
