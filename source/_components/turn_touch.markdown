The `turn_touch` component offers integration with the [Turn Touch](https://shop.turntouch.com/) smart remote. It provides events for button presses as well as a [sensor](/components/sensor.turn_touch) for the remote's battery level.

To use Turn Touch, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
turn_touch:
  devices:
    - mac: '00:de:ad:be:ef:00'
```

{% configuration %}
devices:
  type: list
  required: true
  description: A list of Turn Touch devices.
  keys:
    mac:
      type: string
      required: true
      description: The MAC Address of your Turn Touch remote.
    debounce:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      default: true
      description: Enable debouncing. See below for details.
{% endconfiguration %}

## {% linkable_title Debouncing %}

Turn Touch supports complex button presses (double-tap, hold, and multi-button). Complex button presses generate multiple events (e.g., a double-tap generates two single-press events, followed by the double-tap event). Normally, the single-press events are suppressed by the `debounce` setting. However, this also introduces a 0.75-second delay to all button presses.

If you only plan to use single-press events, set `debounce: false` to bypass the 0.75-second delay.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
turn_touch:
  devices:
    - mac: '00:de:ad:be:ef:00'
      debounce: false           # get instant events for this device
    - mac: 'c0:ff:ee:c0:ff:ee'  # debounce this one (events delayed)
```

## {% linkable_title Events %}

Here is a sample event generated by the Turn Touch component:

```
<Event turntouch_press[L]: press_type=action_west, remote_address=00:de:ad:be:ef:00, entity_id=TurnTouch_00deadbeef00, remote_name=Turn Touch Remote>
```

All Turn Touch press types are supported:

- `action_off`
- `action_north`
- `action_north_double_tap`
- `action_north_hold`
- `action_east`
- `action_east_double_tap`

- `action_west`
