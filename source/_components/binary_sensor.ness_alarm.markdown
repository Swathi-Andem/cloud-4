The `ness_alarm` binary sensor allows you to monitor your [Ness](http://nesscorporation.com/) D8x and D16x alarm zones.

Check the [type/class](/components/binary_sensor/) list for a possible visualization of your zone.

The requirement is that you have setup the [Ness alarm component](/components/ness_alarm/).
