The `rss_feed_template` component can export any information from Home Assistant as static RSS feed. This can be used to display those information on several devices using RSS readers. While native apps for Home Assistant are not widely available, native RSS readers exists for almost any platform.

E.g. on android, the app "Simple RSS Widget" can be used to display temperatures on home screen.


```yaml
# Example configuration.yml entry
rss_feed_template:
  garden:
    title: "Garden {{ as_timestamp(now())|timestamp_custom('%H:%m', True) }}"
    items:
    - title: "Outside temperature"
      description: "{% if is_state('sensor.temp_outside','unknown') %}---{% else %}{{states.sensor.temp_outside.state}} Â°C{% endif %}"
```

Configuration variables:

- **feed_id** (*Required*): The key is used as id of the feed. The feed can be accessed at /api/rss/feed_id (example: 'garden')
- **title** (*Optional*): The title of the feed, which is parsed as [template](/topics/templating/).
- **items** (*Required*): A list of feed items
- **items/title** (*Optional*): The title of the item, which is parsed as [template](/topics/templating/).
- **items/description** (*Optional*): The description of the item, which is parsed as [template](/topics/templating/).
