The `usps` camera component allows you to view the mail piece images made available through USPS via the Informed Delivery service.  You must "Opt-In" to [Informed Delivery](https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/start.action) to see mail images. This works in concert with [USPS sensors](/components/sensor.usps).

To enable this camera in your installation, set up the [USPS component](/components/usps) with your username and password.
