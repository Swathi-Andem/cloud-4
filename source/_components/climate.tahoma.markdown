The `tahoma` climate platform lets you see heat pump derogation added to your Tahoma Box in Home Assistant. This component is a part of the Heat Pump Pack device for electrical consumption monitoring.

Climate will be added automatically. Please refer to the [component](/components/tahoma/) configuration on how to setup Tahoma.
