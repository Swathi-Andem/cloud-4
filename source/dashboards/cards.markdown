There are several built-in card types, each with their own configuration options.

## Adding cards to your dashboard

1. If this is your first time editing a dashboard, [take control of the default dashboard](/dashboards/#get-started-with-your-own-dashboard).

2. Choose one of the two methods to add cards to a dashboard:

{% details "Using the Add Card button" %}

1. In the bottom right, select **Add card**.

2. There are two methods to add a card: **By card** type and **By entity**:
   - **By card** type:
        - If you have an idea of what card type you want to use for an entity, browse the list of available cards.
        - If you are using the **Sections** view, try the **Tile** card in the **Suggested cards** section.

   - **By entity**:
        - If you want to add multiple entities at once, select them from the list.
        - Then, select **Continue**.

Another way to add entities to a dashboard is to use the **Device** page.

1. Go to **{% my integrations title="Settings > Devices & services" %}**.
2. On the integration card of interest, select **Devices**. 
   - If there are multiple devices, select the device from the list.

3. In the **Controls** section, select **Add to Dashboard**.
