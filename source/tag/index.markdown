You've reached this page because you navigated to an NFC or QR Code Tag in the format `https://www.home-assistant.io/tag/{tag}`. When the Home Assistant app is installed, this will [fire an event](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/integrations/universal-links/).

## iOS

If you arrived here after scanning a tag on iOS, and you have the [Home Assistant app](https://companion.home-assistant.io) installed, you may need to activate Universal Links:

1. Long-press on [this link](https://www.home-assistant.io/tag/example_from_documentation)
2. Choose "Open in 'Home Assistant'"
3. Attempt to scan the tag again

If you do not have the Home Assistant app installed, you must do so for scanning these tags to work.
