## The issue

Home Assistant OS publishes specific images which support being run on a virtualized
system. These come with guest tools and other changes to make this easier. The 
image of Home Assistant OS you are running on your virtualized system is not one
of these.

## The solution

You need to reinstall Home Assistant OS using an image which supports being run
on a virtualized system, [see instructions here](/installation/alternative).
