The `proximity` integration allows you to monitor the proximity of devices or persons to a particular [zone](/integrations/zone/) and the direction of travel.

This integration is useful to reduce the number of automation rules required when wanting to perform automations based on locations outside a particular zone. The [zone](/docs/automation/trigger#zone-trigger) and [state](/docs/automation/trigger#state-trigger) based triggers allow similar control but the number of rules grows exponentially when factors such as direction of travel need to be taken into account.

Some examples of its use include:

- Increase thermostat temperature as you near home
- Decrease temperature the further away from home you travel

## Sensors

The following sensor entities will be created.

### Distance

For each tracked device or person, a sensor showing the distance from the monitored zone in a unit depending on your [Home Assistant Unit System](/docs/configuration/basic) selection is created.
You can use the [Min/Max](/integrations/min_max) integration to determine the nearest and furthest distance.

### Direction of travel

For each tracked device or person, a sensor showing the direction of travel to or from the monitored zone is created. Possible states are:

- `arrived`
- `away_from`
- `stationary`
- `towards`
- `unknown`

### Nearest device

A sensor showing the device or person which is nearest to the monitored zone is created.

## Configuration

To enable this integration in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
proximity:
  home: 
    ignored_zones:
      - work
    devices:
      - device_tracker.car1
    tolerance: 50
    unit_of_measurement: mi
```

### Video tutorial
This video tutorial explains how to set up geofencing in Home Assistant using the proximity integration.

To add multiple proximity components, add a mapping to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
proximity:
  home:
    ignored_zones:
      - work
      - school
    devices:
      - device_tracker.car1
      - device_tracker.iphone1
      - device_tracker.iphone2
    tolerance: 50
    unit_of_measurement: mi
  home3:
    zone: home3
    devices:
      - device_tracker.iphone1
    tolerance: 50
  work:
    zone: work
    devices:
      - person.paulus
    tolerance: 10
```
