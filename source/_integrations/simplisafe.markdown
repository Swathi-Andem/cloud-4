The `simplisafe` integration integrates [SimpliSafe home security](https://simplisafe.com) (V2 and V3) systems into Home Assistant. Multiple SimpliSafe accounts can be accommodated.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Alarm control panel**: reports on the current alarm status and can be used to arm and disarm the system.
- **CO detector**: reports on the carbon monoxide sensor status*.
- **Entry sensor**: reports on the current entry sensor status*.
- **Freeze sensor**: reports on the freeze sensor temperature*.
- **Glass Break Sensor**: reports on the glass breakage sensor status*.
- **Lock**: reports on `Door Locks` and can be used to lock and unlock a lock.
- **Motion Sensor**: reports on motion detected*.
- **Siren**: reports on the siren status*.
- **Smoke Detector**: reports on the smoke sensor status*.
- **Smoke+CO Detector**: reports on the smoke and carbon monoxide sensor status*.
- **Water Sensor**: reports on water sensor status*.
- **Outdoor Camera**: capture motion event images and media clips

- Sensor status is only available for SimpliSafe V3 systems and is updated once every 30 seconds, so information displayed in Home Assistant may be delayed.

## SimpliSafe Plans

SimpliSafe offers several [monitoring plans](https://support.simplisafe.com/articles/alarm-events-monitoring/what-are-the-service-plan-options/6344794a013ba90af0bce6a4). All plans (including the free plan) should work with this integration.

## Getting an Authorization Code

<div class='note warning'>
You must have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled on your SimpliSafe account for the below instructions to work. Without MFA enabled, you will never receive the correct authorization code!
</div>

SimpliSafe authenticates users via its web app. Due to technical limitations, there is a manual step when adding the integration. For in-depth guidance, refer to step 6 of [the `simplisafe-python` documentation on authentication](https://simplisafe-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#authentication).

## Events

### `SIMPLISAFE_EVENT`

`SIMPLISAFE_EVENT` events represent events that appear on the timeline of the SimpliSafe
web and mobile apps. When received, they come with event data that contains the
following keys:

- `last_event_changed_by`: the PIN that triggered the event (if appropriate)
- `last_event_type`: the type of event
- `last_event_info`: a human-friendly string describing the event in more detail
- `last_event_sensor_name`: the sensor that triggered the event (if appropriate)
- `last_event_sensor_serial`: the serial number of the sensor that triggered the event (if appropriate)
- `last_event_sensor_type`: the type of sensor that triggered the event (if appropriate)
- `system_id`: the system ID to which the event belongs
- `last_event_timestamp`: the UTC datetime at which the event was received
- `media_urls`: a dict containing media URLs if the event_type is `camera_motion_detected` (see below)

For example, when someone rings the doorbell, a
`SIMPLISAFE_EVENT` event will fire with the following event data:

```python
{
    "event_type": "SIMPLISAFE_EVENT",
    "data": {
        "last_event_changed_by": "",
        "last_event_type": "doorbell_detected",
        "last_event_info": "Someone is at your \"Front Door\"",
        "last_event_sensor_name": "Front Door",
        "last_event_sensor_serial": "",
        "last_event_sensor_type": "doorbell",
        "system_id": [systemid],
        "last_event_timestamp": "2021-01-28T22:01:32+00:00"
    },
    "origin": "LOCAL",
    "time_fired": "2021-01-28T22:01:37.478539+00:00",
    "context": {
        "id": "[id]",
        "parent_id": null,
        "user_id": null
    }
}
```

`last_event_type` can have the following values:

- `automatic_test`
- `camera_motion_detected`
- `doorbell_detected`
- `device_test`
- `secret_alert_triggered`
- `sensor_paired_and_named`
- `user_initiated_test`

If `last_event_type` is `camera_motion_detected` then `SIMPLISAFE_EVENT` will include
a `media_urls` key that is a dictionary that looks like

```python
{
  'image_url': "https://xxx.us-east-1.prd.cam.simplisafe.com/xxx",
  'clip_url': "https://xxx.us-east-1.prd.cam.simplisafe.com/xxx"
}
```

The 'image_url' is an absolute URL to a JPEG file. The 'clip_url' is an absolute URL
to a short MPEG4 video clip. Both refer to the motion detected by the camera.  You
can obtain these files locally using the "capture_motion_image" and "capture_motion_clip"
services respectively.

To build an automation using one of these event types, use `SIMPLISAFE_EVENT`
as an event trigger, with `last_event_type` as the `event_data`.
For example, the following will trigger when the doorbell rings:

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: SIMPLISAFE_EVENT
    event_data:
        last_event_type: doorbell_detected
```

### `SIMPLISAFE_NOTIFICATION`

`SIMPLISAFE_NOTIFICATION` events represent system notifications that would appear in the
messages section of the SimpliSafe web and mobile apps. When received, they come with
event data that contains the following keys:

- `category`: The notification category (e.g., `error`)
- `code`: The SimpliSafe code for the notification
- `message`: The actual text of the notification
- `timestamp`: The UTC timestamp of the notification

Note that when Home Assistant restarts, `SIMPLISAFE_NOTIFICATION` events will fire once
again for any notifications still active in the SimpliSafe web and mobile apps. To
prevent this, either (a) clear them in the web/mobile app or (b) utilize the
`clear_notifications` button provided by the alarm control panel.

### `MOTION EVENT AUTOMATIONS`

When a `camera_motion_event` occurs on a camera (currently only outdoor cameras are supported),
you may want to capture the image and video clip associated with that event.  First create a trigger
that looks something like this:

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: SIMPLISAFE_EVENT
    event_data:
        last_event_type: camera_motion_detected
        last_event_sensor_type: OUTDOOR_CAMERA
        last_event_sensor_serial: f11b6abd
```

where the `last_event_sensor_serial` is the serial number of a specifc camera you are targeting.  One
way to obtain that serial number is to use the "Developer tools" and listen on `SIMPLISAFE_EVENT` events
and then walk in front of your camera.  `last_event_sensor_serial` will contain that serial number.

Then for actions associated with that trigger, something like this:

{% raw %}

```yaml
service: simplisafe.capture_motion_clip
data:
  entity_id: camera.back_yard_camera_one
  filename: >-
    /config/www/simplisafe/back_yard/clips/{{now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}}.mp4
```

{% endraw %}

and

```yaml
service: simplisafe.capture_motion_image
data:
  width: 720
  filename: "/config/www/simplisafe/back_yard/latest.jpg"
  entity_id: camera.back_yard_camera_one
```

In this example, we are creating a directory structure that contains the latest image, and a history of
video clips.  You could use the "files" integration and this snippet in your "configuration.yaml" file:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: files
    folder: /config/www/simplisafe/back_yard/clips
    name: back_yard_media
```
