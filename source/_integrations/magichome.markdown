The `magichome` integration is the main integration to integrate all [Zengge Smart](http://zengge.com/) related platforms. You will need your Magic Home Pro account information (username, password and account country code) to discover and control devices which related to your account.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:


- **Light** - The platform supports most kinds of MagicHome light and controller.
- **Switch** - The platform supports switch and socket.


## Configuration

To add your MagicHome devices into your Home Assistant installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
magichome:
  username: YOUR_MAGICHOME_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_MAGICHOME_PASSWORD
  company: ZG001
  platform: ZG001
```

{% configuration %}

## Service

These services are available for the `magichome` component:

- force_update
- pull_devices

Devices state data and new devices will refresh automatically. If you want to refresh all devices information or get new devices related to your account manually, you can call the `force_update` or `pull_devices` service.
