The `bring` **to-do list** allows you to interact with your [Bring!](https://www.getbring.com/) shopping lists from within Home Assistant.

The authentication uses directly your `email` / `password` and if you want to automatically receive notifications via the Bring! App when Home Assistant adds or removes an item from the list, you should use a dedicated account (such as `email:Â your.name+ha@gmail.com`) to connect Home Assistant with [Bring!](https://www.getbring.com/).
