The **Bring** integration allows you to interact with your [Bring!](https://www.getbring.com/) shopping lists within Home Assistant.

For authentication, the integration requires the `email` and `password` you used for your Bring! account. If you want to automatically receive notifications via the Bring! app when Home Assistant adds or removes an item from the list, you should use a dedicated account (such as `email:Â your.name+ha@gmail.com`) to connect Home Assistant with [Bring!](https://www.getbring.com/).

## Services

You can use the services from the [to-do list](/integrations/todo/) to create, update or delete items on your Bring! shopping lists.

### Notifications

The **Bring** integration offers a service to send push notifications to the Bring! mobile apps of other members of a shared shopping list. The Bring! mobile app has 4 predefined notification types. Note: If you want to receive these notifications yourself, you need to use a dedicated account as mentioned above.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id`            |       no | Entity of the Bring! list whose members should be notified.
| `notification_type`    |       no | Type of push notification to send to list members. See [Notification types](#available-notification-types)
| `item_name`            |      yes | **Required for urgent message.** Item name to include in in the message e.g.: 'Breaking news - Please get cilantro!'

### Available Notification types
