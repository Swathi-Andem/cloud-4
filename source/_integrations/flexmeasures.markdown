The `flexmeasures` integration offers an integration with [FlexMeasures](https://flexmeasures.io/) instances to schedule flexible energy assets.

FlexMeasures can be used to schedule batteries, EV's, heat storage, and other assets. The current integration only supports car batteries and battery optimizations. Shiftable energy assets like dishwashing machines are currently not supported in the integration. The integration offers the following sensor and services:

- A sensor for flexible asset schedules
- A service to retrieve a schedule
- A service to post measurements to a FlexMeasures instance
- A service to change an S2 control type



To add this integration the following configuration input is needed:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
flexmeasures:
  host: "FLEXMEASURES_INSTANCE"
  username: "USERNAME"
  password: "PASSWORD"
  power_sensor: "POWER_SENSOR_ID"

## Schedule Sensor

The Flexmeasures Schedule sensor shows the values of the power draw or supply at the start of each interval. It contains a start datetime, unit of measurement, and a device class as well. The schedule is automatically shifted up to be in line with the sensor resolution. 

```yaml
schedule:
  - start: '2023-09-04T17:45:00+02:00'
    value: -0.5
  - start: '2023-09-04T18:00:00+02:00'
    value: -0.5
start: '2023-09-04T17:45:00+02:00'
unit_of_measurement: MWh
device_class: energy
friendly_name: FlexMeasures Schedule
```

## The scheduling service

For a schedule to be calculated a `soc_at_start` is required. All other variables needed to calculate a new schedule were provided in the configuration. The following `yaml` file will trigger a schedule and update the sensor:

```yaml
service: flexmeasures.trigger_and_get_schedule
data:
  soc_at_start: "FLOAT_SOC_AT_START"
```

## Automate scheduling

The intended usage of FlexMeasures is letting the schedules and Home Assistant optimize the flexible energy assets without user interaction. Automations can be used to trigger new schedules when new information is available that would impact the schedule. Some examples of events that should trigger the request of new schedules are when the battery/asset is connected, when new prices are available, and periodically to match the executed schedule to the calculated schedule. The user will need to provide a Home Assistant entity as a `soc_at_start` to be used for triggering a schedule. This is an example `yaml` for the action set in the automations:

```yaml
service: flexmeasures.trigger_and_get_schedule
data:
  soc_at_start: "\{\{ state_attr('SENSOR_TYPE.SENSOR', 'SENSOR_ATTRIBUTES') }}"
```

## Posting measurement data

FlexMeasures needs data to calculate the optimal schedules for flexible assets. This data can be posted to the FlexMeasures instance using the `flexmeasures` integration. To post data the following `yaml` can be used:

```yaml
service: flexmeasures.post_measurements
data:
  sensor_id: SENSOR_TO_POST_DATA_TO_INT
  start: "DATETIME_STRING_OF_FIRST_DATA_POINT"
  duration: "DATETIME_DURATION_STRING_FOR_THE_COLLECTED_VALUES"
  unit: "SENSOR_UNIT_OF_THE_VALUES"
  prior: "DATETIME_STRING_AT_WHICH_THE_VALUES_WERE_RECORDED_OR_FORECASTED"
```

## S2 Protocol

The S2 Protocol is a communication standard for devices with energy flexibility.
It supports sending descriptions of energy flexibility and preference for activation between a Resource Manager (RM) and a Customer Energy Manager (CEM).

This integration allows running Home Assistant as a CEM, by receiving and sending S2 messages with websockets and using FlexMeasures to optimize device activation.

Scheduling recommendations automatically start when a RM sends a system description and/or state changes. For RMs that allow multiple control types, users can switch between them in Home Assistant.

## Changing the control type

A user can use the service change_control_type to change the control type of the resource manager, for example:

```yaml
service: flexmeasures.change_control_type
data:
  control_type: "FILL_RATE_BASED_CONTROL"
```
