Both Matter and the implementation within Home Assistant are in early (v1) state and features may be missing or could be improved.

If you run Home Assistant Container, Home Assistant Core, or you donâ€™t want to use the built-in Matter Server add-on, please see the [advanced installation instructions](#advanced-installation-instructions).


## Advanced installation instructions

If you are using Home Assistant Container, Home Assistant Core, or you don't want to use the built-in Matter Server add-on, you will need to run the Matter Server yourself, to which the Matter integration will connect.

### Running Matter Server

This application provides the connection between your Matter network (called Fabric in technical terms) and Home Assistant. The Home Assistant Matter integration connects to this server via a websocket connection. You need to run the Matter Server before you can use the integration.

There are multiple ways to run the server:

**Option 1: The official Matter Server add-on, as described above**

_This option is only available for Home Assistant OS (the recommended installation type) and Home Assistant Supervised installations._

**Option 2: Run the Matter server yourself**

This option is considered a very advanced setup and only for experienced users. You can find instructions on how to run the Matter Server in the [project repository](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/python-matter-server).
