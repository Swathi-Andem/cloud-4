The `zamg` platform uses meteorological details published by the Austrian weather service [Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG)](https://www.zamg.ac.at).

Only observations for capital cities are publicly available. You can check the list of stations in [CSV format](https://www.zamg.ac.at/ogd).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Weather** - It displays the current temperature, humidity, pressure and wind speed, but it doesn't have support for conditions which is a key feature of the `weather` platforms.
- **[Sensor](#sensor)**
