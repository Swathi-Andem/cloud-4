The Starlink integration allows you to integrate your [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) into Home Assistant.

**Important:** Your Starlink must **not** be in bypass mode. In this mode, the local API is unavailable, and this integration will not work.

### Sensor

The following sensors are added for each Starlink system:

- Ping - The ping that Starlink has measured, in ms
- Azimuth - The direction Dishy is facing in degrees
- Elevation - Dishy's current elevation in degrees
- Uplink throughput - The amount of data being uploaded through Starlink in Mbit/s
- Downlink throughput - The amount of data being downloaded through Starlink in Mbit/s
- Last boot time - The time Starlink was last turned on
