With the Gandi.net integration, you can keep your [Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net) LiveDNS record up to date.

## Prerequisites

Setup requires a unique Gandi API Key. If you donâ€™t have one yet, you can generate your production API key from the API Key Page in the Security section.

Note that it does not create the initial DNS record but only updates it; you will still have to do this manually.

### Service `gandi_livedns.update_record`

The integration runs at regular intervals, but can also be started manually by using the service `gandi_livedns.update_records` under services.
