The `deako` platform allows you to control your [Deako](https://deako.com) devices from Home Assistant.

In order for this integration to work, your devices must be listed **online**, viewable in the Deako app.

Current devices supported:

- all smart Deako devices

Features not currently supported:

- Deako groups
- Deako scenes

This integration uses the [`pydeako`](https://pypi.org/project/pydeako/) library to connect to and interact with devices. Devices are automatically discovered via mDNS.
