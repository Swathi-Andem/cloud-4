The `ted5000` monitors electricity consumption/production by connecting to the [TED](https://www.theenergydetective.com/home) gateway, itself connected to one or several Measuring Transmitting Units (MTU). The platform creates up to five sensors per MTU depending on config mode

All modes:
- Power (W)
- Voltage (V)

Advanced and extended modes:
- Energy Daily (kWh)
- Energy Monthly (kWh)
- Power Factor (%)

In addition to above MTU sensors, nine utility sensors are added in extended mode.

Extended mode:
- MTUs Quantity
- Current Rate $/kWh
- Days left in billing cycle
- Plan type (Flat, Tier, TOU, Tier+TOU)
- Current Tier (0 = Disabled)
- Current TOU (0 = Disabled)
- Current TOU Description (if Current TOU is 0 => Not Configured)
- Carbon Rate lbs/kW
- Meter read date


If you want to enable the ted5000 sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: ted5000
    host: 192.168.1.100
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP address of your ted gateway.
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: The port of your ted gateway.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 80
name:
  description: Name of the ted gateway.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: ted
mode:
  description: Configuration mode. `base`, `advanced`, `extended`.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: base
{% endconfiguration %}

The platform creates the following sensors depending on the configured mode:

Base mode:
For each plugged MTU, using an index starting at 1
```yaml
sensor.<name>_mtu<MTU id>_power
sensor.<name>_mtu<MTU id>_voltage
```

Advanced mode:
For each plugged MTU, using an index starting at 1
```yaml
sensor.<name>_mtu<MTU id>_power
sensor.<name>_mtu<MTU id>_voltage
sensor.<name>_mtu<MTU id>_energy_daily
sensor.<name>_mtu<MTU id>_energy_monthly
sensor.<name>_mtu<MTU id>_power_factor
```

Extended mode:
All sensors from advanced mode and the following in addition:
```yaml
sensor.<name>_utility_mtu_quantity
sensor.<name>_utility_current_rate
sensor.<name>_utility_days_left_billing_cycle
sensor.<name>_utility_plan_type
sensor.<name>_utility_current_tier
sensor.<name>_utility_current_tou
sensor.<name>_utility_current_tou_description
sensor.<name>_utility_carbon_rate
sensor.<name>_utility_meter_read_date
```
