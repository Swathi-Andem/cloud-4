*Integrates your weather station seamlessly into Home Assistant.*

This integration will listen for data from your station and passes them into respective sensors.
Also you are able to push data to Windy API.

## Requirements

- [Sencor SWS 12500 Weather Station](https://www.sencor.cz/profesionalni-meteorologicka-stanice/sws-12500)
- Station set to send data directly to Home Assistant
- Open communication between station and Home Assistant
- If you want to push data to Windy, you have to create account at [Windy](https://stations.windy.com)

## Configure your station in AP mode

You need to configure your station in AP mode to send data to your local Home Assistant installation.

- hold WiFi button on the back of station for 6 seconds until AP will flash on display.
- select your station from available APs on your computer
- connect to station's setup page: `http://192.168.1.1` from your browser
- in the third URL section fill in address to your local Home Assistant installation
- fill in `ID` and `KEY`. You can use [online tool](https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx) to generate random keys.

Now *Let's add the integration to Home Assistant*

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

Once integration is installed to Home Assistant, you need to provide set of `API_ID` and `API_KEY` as you defined them in your station:

```plain
API_ID: ID in station's config
API_KEY: PASSWORD in station's config
```

If your security data is changed for some reason, you need to reconfigure the platform.

As soon as the integration is added into Home Assistant it will listen for incoming data from station and starts to fill sensors as soon as data will first arrive.

## Resending data to Windy API

- first of all you need to create account at [Windy stations](https://stations.windy.com). Once you have an account, copy Windy API Key
- provide Windy API key to SWS 12500 integration
- tick `Enable` checkbox
- you are done.
