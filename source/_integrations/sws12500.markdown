Integrates your weather station seamlessly into Home Assistant.

This integration will listen for data from your station and passes them to respective sensors. It also provides the ability to push data to Windy API.

## Requirements

- [Sencor SWS 12500 Weather Station](https://www.sencor.cz/profesionalni-meteorologicka-stanice/sws-12500).
- Configure station to send data directly to Home Assistant.
- If you want to push data to Windy, you have to create an account at [Windy](https://stations.windy.com).

## Configure your station in AP mode

1. Hold the Wi-Fi button on the back of the station for 6 seconds until the AP will flash on the display.
2. Select your station from available APs on your computer.
3. Connect to the station's setup page: `http://192.168.1.1` from your browser.
4. In the third URL section fill in the address to your local Home Assistant installation.
5. Create new `ID` and `KEY`. You can use [online tool](https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx) to generate random keys. _(you will need them to configure integation to Home Assistatnt)_
6. Save your configuration.

Now _Let's add the integration to Home Assistant_
{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

Once integration is added to Home Assistant, configuration dialog will ask you for `API_ID` and `API_KEY` as you set them in your station:

```plain
API_ID: ID in station's config
API_KEY: PASSWORD in station's config
```

![config dialog](/images/integrations/sws12500/cfg_dialog.png)

If you chanage `API ID` or `API KEY` in the station, you have to reconfigure integration to accept data from your station.

- In `Settings` -> `Devices & services` find SWS12500 and click `Configure`.
- In dialog box choose `Basic - Configure credentials`

As soon as the integration is added into Home Assistant it will listen for incoming data from station and starts to fill sensors as soon as data will first arrive.

## Resending data to Windy API

- First of all you need to create account at [Windy stations](https://stations.windy.com).
- Once you have an account created, copy your Windy API Key.
![windy api key](/images/integrations/sws12500/windy_key.png)

- In dialog box choose `Windy configuration`.
![config dialog](/images/integrations/sws12500/cfg.png)

- Fill in `Key` you were provided at `Windy stations`.
