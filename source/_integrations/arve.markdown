The **Arve** {% term integration %} provides the ability to monitor real life air quality data, measured by your [Arve](https://www.arveair.com) device.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

To create an integration for an Arve device, the user needs to fill in three required fields.
Those are _Home Assistant acess token_, _Arve customer token_ and _Serial number_.
_Home Assistant access token_ and _Arve customer token_ can be obtained by the user on the [Arve web platform](https://dashboard.arveair.com).
The _serial number_ is located on the rear panel of the Arve device.
