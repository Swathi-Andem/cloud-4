Integrate [Shelly devices](https://shelly.cloud) into Home Assistant.

## Configuration

To add a Shelly device to your installation, make sure they are connected to your Wi-Fi network first. Next, go to **Configuration** >> **Integrations** in the UI. If the new device is on the same network as Home Assistant, it is discovered automatically. Clicking "Configure" on the discovered device, adds it to Home Assistant. If your device isn't discovered automatically, click the button with `+` sign on the integrations page and from the list of integrations, select **Shelly** and follow the instructions shown.

<div class="note">
Integration is communicating directly with the device; cloud connection is not needed.

## Entities naming
If `Device Name` or `Channel Name` is set in the device the integration will use them to generate the entities name. 
If channel names are set, they will be used as entities names and the device name will not be used.
If only device name is set, and the device name contain multiple channels the channel number will be appended to the entity name (e.g. Channel 2).
In case device name and channel names are not set, the entities name will be generated by the `Device Type`, `Device ID` and `Channel Number`.

Examples:
| Device Name | Channel Name   | Enitiy Name                     |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------------------------|
| `Not set`   |	`Not Set`	     | shellyswitch25-ABC123 Channel 1 |
| `Not set`	  | Kids Room Bulb | Kids Room Bulb                  |
| Kitchen     |	`Not Set`	     | Kitchen Channel 1               |
| Bedroom	    | Round Bulb     | Round Bulb                      |
