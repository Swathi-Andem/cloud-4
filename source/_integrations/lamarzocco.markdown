This integration interacts with [La Marzocco coffee machines](https://lamarzocco.com/it/en/) through calls to the LaMarzocco cloud API and (optionally) local API calls, which include a WebSocket connection for (near) real-time updates. 

To be able to configure your machine in Home Assistant, your machine needs to be added to your account using the official La Marzocco app first. Currently, only login with username & password is supported. If you are currently using a social login, you need to create a new LaMarzocco account and transfer your machine to it to be able to use this integration.
