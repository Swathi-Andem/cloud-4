The `Overkiz by Somfy` integration platform is used by many different vendors, like Somfy, Hitachi and Atlantic. This integration will allow users to integrate their devices into Home Assistant using the Overkiz API.

## Supported hubs

- Atlantic Cozytouch
- Hitachi Hi Kumo
- Nexity EugÃ©nie
- Rexel Energeasy Connect
- Somfy TaHoma Box
- Somfy Connexoon IO
- Somfy Connexoon RTS

If you use a Somfy hub, you could also use the [Somfy integration](/integrations/somfy/) which utilises the official API.

## Supported devices

Over 6,000 devices from 60 brands compatible with the Overkiz platform. This integration will pull your devices and map them to the Home Assistant platforms.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Options

Overkiz options are configured via Configuration -> Integrations -> Overkiz by Somfy -> Options.

### Update Interval

The Overkiz integration periodically retrieves new events. Change the update interval to a lower value if you want more frequent updates, for example when you also control your devices outside Home Assistant.

## Known limitations

### Z-Wave, Hue and Sonos not supported

Even though Overkiz supports adding Z-Wave, Hue and Sonos devices, this isn't supported in the Overkiz integration. All these platforms have native integrations in Home Assistant which are more stable and have more features.

### Overkiz API limits

`Execution queue is full on gateway: #xxxx-xxxx-xxxx (soft limit: 10)`

`Server busy, please try again later. (Too many executions)`
