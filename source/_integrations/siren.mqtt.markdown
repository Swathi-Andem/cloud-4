The `mqtt` siren platform lets you control your MQTT enabled sirens and text based notification devices.

## Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT siren will receive an instant state update after subscription, and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the siren will be `false` / `off`.

When a `state_topic` is not available, the siren will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the siren will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the siren will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if the `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect operation.

The MQTT siren platform has a built-in integration with the notify platform. If `message_command_topic` is configured the siren platform will also setup the MQTT notify platform. The `{service_name}` is derived from `target`, or if `target` is not configured from `name` and will finally fallback to `message_command_topic`. Invalid characters in the service name will be removed. For each siren entity that is set up with `message_command_topic` a notify service is registered with name `notify.mqtt_{service_name}`.

Additional there is a common service `notify.mqtt`. This service can be called using the `target` attribute that takes a list of siren targets that should be notified. The following target naming is supported:

- The value configured with `message_command_topic` (the `target_id`).
- The value configured with `target` or `name`.
- The derived `{service_name}`.

To enable this siren in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
siren:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "home/bedroom/siren/set"
    message_command_topic: "home/bedroom/siren/notify_set"

Make sure that your topic matches exactly. `some-topic/` and `some-topic` are different topics.

## Examples

In this section, you will find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

### Full configuration

The example below shows a full configuration for a siren.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
siren:
  - platform: mqtt
    unique_id: custom_siren
    name: "Intrusion siren"
    state_topic: "home/alarm/siren1"
    command_topic: "home/alarm/siren1/set"
    tone_command_topic: "home/alarm/siren1/tone_set"
    available_tones:
      - ping
      - siren
    duration_command_topic: "home/alarm/siren1/duration_set"
    volume_command_topic: "home/alarm/siren1/volume_set"
    message_command_topic: "home/alarm/siren1/message_set"
    message_command_template: "{{ title }}: {{ message }}"
    availability:
      - topic: "home/alarm/siren1/available"
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    state_on: "ON"
    state_off: "OFF"
    optimistic: false
    qos: 0
    retain: true
```

{% endraw %}

For a check, you can use the command line tools `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` to send MQTT messages. This allows you to operate your siren manually:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home/alarm/siren1 -m "ON"
```
