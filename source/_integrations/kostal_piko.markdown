The Kostal Piko integration allows you to get data from [Kostal Piko](https://www.kostal-solar-electric.com/) solar inverters and integrate them into your Home Assistant installation.

The integration uses the REST-API interface which is also used by the integrated Web-UI and therefore uses the same password.

## Sensors

By default all sensors are enabled, but they can be disabled using the built-in deactivation feature of Home Assistant .

<div class='note'>
Currently, most of the values under the "Current Values" section in the Web Interface are available.
