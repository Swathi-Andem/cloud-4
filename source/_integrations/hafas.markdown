The `hafas` sensor will give you the departure time of the next train for the given connection. In case of a delay, the delay is also shown. Additional details are used to inform about, e.g., the type of the train, price, and if it is on time.

The integration supports fetching train tables from "Deutsche Bahn" as well as from "Verkehrsverbund SÃ¼d-Niedersachsen". 

The integration uses [pyhafas](https://pypi.org/project/pyhafas/) as the data source. [HaFAS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAFAS) is a public transport management system developed by a company called [HaCon](https://www.hacon.de/).
