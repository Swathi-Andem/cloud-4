## Configuration

To add the AVM FRITZ!DECT integration (which is a part of the AVM FRITZ!Box integration) to your installation, go to **Configuration** -> **Integrations** in the UI, click the button with `+` sign and from the list of integrations select **AVM FRITZ!Box**.

If you have enabled SSDP discovery, itâ€™s likely that you just have to confirm the detected device with username and password.

### Configuration via YAML

YAML configuration is still around for people that prefer YAML, but it's deprecated and you should not use it anymore.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
fritzbox:
  devices:
    - password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```


{% configuration %}
devices:
  description: A list of FRITZ! devices.
  type: map
  keys:
    host:
      description: The hostname or IP address of the FRITZ!Box. (e.g. fritz.box or 192.168.178.1)
      required: false
      type: string
      default: fritz.box
    username:
      description: The username for Smart Home access. **("Smart Home" persmission is needed!)** 
      required: false
      type: string
      default: admin
    password:
      description: The password of the user.
      required: true
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}
