This integration allows [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) devices to connect directly to Home Assistant with the [native ESPHome API](https://esphome.io/components/api.html).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Home Assistant service calls

ESPHome devices can make service calls to any [Home Assistant service](https://esphome.io/components/api.html#homeassistant-service-action). This functionality is not enabled by default for newly configured device, but can be turned on the options flow on a per device basis.
