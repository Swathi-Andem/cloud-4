# Home Assistant User Manual

## Components

Swidget Smart Home products are comprised of a *HOST* wiring device and one of an assortment of interchangeable smart inserts.

Each device combination has an assortment of Control capabilities, as well as Sensor capabilities. These are Home Assistant (HA) Entities.

### Setup

1. **Installation**

Place a Wi-Fi Insert into the *HOST* wiring device. The Insert will take approximately one minute to initiate.

2. **Discovery Mode**

When the Insert is blinking green, it is in *Discovery* mode and ready to be paired.

**Note: For security purposes, your Swidget Insert remains in discovery mode for 5 minutes. If the insert is no longer broadcasting, remove and reinsert into host.**

3. **Firmware and Updates**

Swidget Inserts must be running firmware V1.4 or later in order to support local control.

Firmware can be found at https://homeassistant.swidget.com

To check and/or update the firmware, connect a wi-fi enabled computer to the Swidget SSID being broadcast by the Swidget Insert.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://10.123.45.1:90 and check the version code

To update, select file, select the local control firmware and select Update

4. **Local Provisioning**

Once completed, reconnect to the Swidget SSID and navigate to https://10.123.45.1/provision

Enter the SSID and password of the network being used by the Control4 system.

**Optional - Enter a user-defined security key in the Set Key field. Record this key as it will be required later in the provisioning process.***

Select *Disable Authentication Method*

**Optional - Add a static IP address**

Note the IP Address to manually add Swidget device
