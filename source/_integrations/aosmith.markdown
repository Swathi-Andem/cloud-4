The A. O. Smith integration allows you to control a compatible A. O. Smith iCOMM-enabled water heater from Home Assistant.

Before using this integration, your water heater must be connected to a Wi-Fi network and linked to your account using the A. O. Smith mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-o-smith/id456489822)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aosmith.warrantycheck)).

## Known compatible models

- [HPTS-50](https://www.hotwater.com/products/HPTS-50-SG200.html)
- [HPTS-66](https://www.hotwater.com/products/HPTS-66-SG200.html)
- [HPTS-80](https://www.hotwater.com/products/HPTS-80-SG200.html)

Water heaters that can be controlled using the A. O. Smith mobile app should be compatible with this integration. If your water heater is not detected by the integration, but it can be controlled using the mobile app, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml&integration_name=A.%20O.%20Smith&integration_link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.home-assistant.io%2Fintegrations%2Faosmith) so that support can be added. Similarly, if your water heater is working with this integration, but its model number is not listed here, please [open an documentation issue](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/issues/new?template=feedback.yml&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.home-assistant.io%2Fintegrations%2Faosmith) so it can be added to the list.
