[Home Panel](https://timmo.dev/home-panel/) is a customizable, themeable
interface which acts as an additional frontend for Home Assistant. The
`home_panel` integration allows you to send commands to it's UI as well as
monitor the changes in config.

## Configuration via the frontend

Menu: **Configuration** -> **Integrations**.

Click on the `+` sign to add an integration and click on **Home Panel**.
Follow the configuration flow, after finishing, the Home Panel
integration will be available.

If you are using the add-on, make sure you have exposed the port in the
add-on's config, as this is required for Home Assistant to see the app.

## Service

The `home_panel.send_command` service allows you to send commands to the
logged in users' UI to, for example, expand a camera feed.
