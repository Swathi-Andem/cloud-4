With the `ddns_ovh` integration you can keep your current IP address in sync with your [OVH.com](https://www.ovh.com) domain.

Integration can work in two modes based on `triggered_by_event` configuration setting:

1. default or `triggered_by_event=false` - automatic which periodically (once per minute) invokes OVH DDNS service which based on the caller's IP assigns it to appropriate domain

2. `triggered_by_event=true` - requires external component which discovers external IP address and broadcasts it by firing `external_ip_provided_event` event. The event is handled by `ddns_ovh` component and invokes OVH DDNS service with the IP to assign it to appropriate domain. The event data sent by external component has to match the following json: `{ "ip": "X.X.X.X" }`. This mode can be helpful if your ISP is doing some kind of proxy that hides your routers IP public address. External component that discovers or publish public IP address of router can be the router itself for example it can be visible in Home Assistant thanks to [UPnP](/integrations/upnp) integration.

Information about configuration of dynamic DNS for a domainÂ name can be found under following [link](https://docs.ovh.com/ie/en/domains/hosting_dynhost/).

To use the integration in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
ddns_ovh:
  domain: subdomain.domain.com
  username: YOUR_DYN_HOST_USERNAME_SUFFIX
  password: YOUR_DYN_HOST_PASSWORD
```
