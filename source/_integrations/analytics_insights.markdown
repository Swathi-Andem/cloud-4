The **Analytics Insights** {% term integration %} allows you to get integration usage statistics into Home Assistant.
The data comes from [Home Assistant Analytics](https://analytics.home-assistant.io/).
For more information about the component that collects analytics, checkout [Analytics](/analytics).

Only integrations with one or more active installations will be displayed. This means it will take some time before newly released integrations are visible.
