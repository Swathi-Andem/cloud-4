The `mqtt` device trigger platform uses an MQTT message payload to generate device trigger events.

An MQTT device trigger is a better option than a [binary sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor.mqtt/) for buttons, remote controls etc.

## Configuration

MQTT device triggers are only supported through [MQTT discovery](/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery), manual setup through `configuration.yaml` is not supported.
The discovery topic needs to be: `<discovery_prefix>/device_automation/[<node_id>/]<object_id>/config`. Note that only one trigger may be defined per unique discovery topic. Also note that the combination of `type` and `subtype` should be unique for a device.

### Example MQTT discovery

This shows a complete example of defining a remote control type device with two triggers: "left arrow click" and "right arrow click".

Note that it is not necessary to provide the full device information in each message, but the identifying information, `identifier` in the example, must be the same.

#### Left arrow click configuration

- Discovery topic: `homeassistant/device_automation/0x90fd9ffffedf1266/action_arrow_left_click/config`
- Discovery payload:

  ```json
  {
      "automation_type": "trigger",
      "type": "action",
      "subtype": "arrow_left_click",
      "payload": "arrow_left_click",
      "topic": "zigbee2mqtt/0x90fd9ffffedf1266/action",
      "device": {
          "identifiers": [
              "zigbee2mqtt_0x90fd9ffffedf1266"
          ],
          "name": "0x90fd9ffffedf1266",
          "sw_version": "Zigbee2MQTT 1.14.0",
          "model": "TRADFRI remote control (E1524/E1810)",
          "manufacturer": "IKEA"
      }
  }
  ```

- Trigger topic: `zigbee2mqtt/0x90fd9ffffedf1266/action`
- Trigger payload: `arrow_left_click`

#### Right arrow click configuration

- Discovery topic: `homeassistant/device_automation/0x90fd9ffffedf1266/action_arrow_right_click/config`
- Discovery payload:

  ```json
  {
      "automation_type": "trigger",
      "type": "action",
      "subtype": "arrow_right_click",
      "payload": "arrow_right_click",
      "topic": "zigbee2mqtt/0x90fd9ffffedf1266/action",
      "device": {
          "identifiers": [
              "zigbee2mqtt_0x90fd9ffffedf1266"
          ]
      }
  }   
  ```

- Trigger topic: `zigbee2mqtt/0x90fd9ffffedf1266/action`
- Trigger payload: `arrow_right_click`

### Example attaching a trigger from a device automation using templates

A device automation with an MQTT device trigger can be fully set up through the UI.
In some cases it can be useful to to use templates, e.g. to set the `discovery_id` using a variable.
The parameters `discovery_id`, `type` and `subtype` support templating using the [trigger variables](/docs/automation/trigger/#trigger-variables).

{% raw %}

The following example shows how the `discovery_id` can be set as a variable to be using in a template.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml
automation:
  trigger_variables:
    discovery_id: '0x90fd9ffffedf1266'
  trigger:
  - platform: device
    domain: mqtt
    device_id: c2962db89494eb88654c20c34fab9285
    type: action
    subtype: arrow_left_click
    discovery_id: '{{ discovery_id }} action_arrow_left_click'
  condition: []
  action:
  - service: notify.persistent_notification
    data:
      message: "Arrow left clicked"
  mode: single
```

{% endraw %}

### Example setting up MQTT device trigger using a blueprint

The following shows an example how MQTT triggers can be set up using a blueprint:

{% raw %}

```yaml
blueprint:
  name: Ikea Tradfri Dimmer as Shutter Remote (Zigbee2MQTT)
  description: |
    Control a shutter with an Ikea Tradfri Dimmer over Zigbee2MQTT
  domain: automation
  input:
    remote:
      name: Remote
      description: IKEA Tradfri Dimmer remote to use
      selector:
        device:
          integration: mqtt
          manufacturer: IKEA
          model: TRADFRI ON/OFF switch (E1743)
    cover:
      name: Shutter
      description: The shutter to control
      selector:
        target:
          entity:
            domain: cover
              
trigger_variables:
  input_remote: !input remote
  input_cover: !input cover
  input_discovery_id: "{{ device_entities(input_remote)[0].split('.')[1].split('_')[0] }}"

trigger:
  - platform: device
    domain: mqtt
    device_id: !input remote
    type: action
    subtype: "on"
    discovery_id: "{{ input_discovery_id }} action_on"
    
  - platform: device
    domain: mqtt
    device_id: !input remote
    type: action
    subtype: "off"
    discovery_id: "{{ input_discovery_id }} action_off"
    
action:
- choose:
  - conditions:
    - '{{ trigger.payload == "on" }}'
    sequence:
    - service: >
        {% if is_state(input_cover.entity_id, 'opening') %}
          cover.stop_cover
        {% else %}
          cover.open_cover
        {% endif %}
      target: !input cover
  - conditions:
    - '{{ trigger.payload == "off" }}'
    sequence:
    - service: >
        {% if is_state(input_cover.entity_id, 'closing') %}
          cover.stop_cover
        {% else %}
          cover.close_cover
        {% endif %}
      target: !input cover
mode: restart
```

{% endraw %}
