The Motionblinds BLE {% term integration %} adds support for [Motionblinds](https://motionblinds.com/) Bluetooth motors. Beware that this integration does not work with *Eve Motionblinds* motors. *Eve Motionblinds* can be added to Home Assistant using the [HomeKit Device](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit_controller/) integration.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Setup

During the setup of a Motionblinds BLE device, you will be asked what kind of blind your Motionblind is. There are 8 different blind types:

- **Roller blind**: has the ability to change position and speed.
- **Honeycomb blind**: has the ability to change position and speed.
- **Roman blind**: has the ability to change position and speed.
- **Venetian blind**: has the ability to change position, tilt, and speed.
- **Venetian blind (tilt-only)**: has the ability to change tilt and speed.
- **Double Roller blind**: has the ability to change position, tilt, and speed.
- **Curtain blind**: has the ability to change position. May need to be calibrated if the end positions are lost, which can be done by using the open/close cover button or the set cover position slider. This will trigger a calibration which will first make the curtain find the end positions after which it will run to the position as indicated by the command that was given.
- **Vertical blind**: has the ability to change position and tilt. May need to be calibrated if the end positions are lost, which has to be done using the Motionblinds BLE mobile app.

## Entities

The following entities are available for a Motionblinds BLE device:

- [Cover](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cover/) entity: depending on the blind that was chosen during the setup, this entity has a slider that makes it possible to change position and tilt, and buttons that allow you to open the blind, close the blind, tilt it open, tilt it closed and stop it.
- [Button](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/button/) entities:
  -  Connect button: allows you to connect to the blind.
  -  Disconnect button: allows you to disconnect the blind.
  -  Favorite button: allows you to move the blind to the favorite position.
- [Select](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/select/) entities:
  -  Speed select: allows you to change the speed of the motor to low, medium, or high. Available for all blinds except a curtain blind and a vertical blind.

## Services

Since Motionblinds BLE motors require a Bluetooth connection to control them, Home Assistant does not get automatic updates of the motor's state by default. Therefore, you can use the [homeassistant.update_entity](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/service-calls/#homeassistant-services) service on a Motionblinds BLE entity which will connect to your Motionblind and update the state of all entities belonging to the device. **However, be aware that doing so may impact battery life.**

This can also be automated using a YAML automation. For instance, the following automation connects to your Motionblind every 24 hours to update it's state in Home Assistant:

```yaml
alias: Motionblinds BLE polling automation
mode: single
trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    hours: "/24"
action:
  - service: homeassistant.update_entity
    target:
      entity_id: cover.motion_shade
```
