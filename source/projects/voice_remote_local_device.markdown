title: "Setting up a fully local voice remote device"
---

If you have Home Assistant Cloud, the voice assistant uses Home Assistant Cloud by default.
This is because the Cloud version currently still performs better than the local version.
The performance depends a bit on the hardware you run it on. To set up a fully local, private voice assistant, follow these steps.

Currently, there are two version of voice remote devices supported to talk to Home Assistant: 
   * Using a classic analog telephone
   * Using an ATOM Echo

## Setting up a voice remote using ATOM Echo

## Required material

* Latest version of Home Assistant installed on your Home Assistant device 
* [Assist Pipeline](/integrations/assist_pipeline)
* The password to your 2.4&nbsp;GHz Wi-Fi network
* Chrome (or a Chromium-based browser like Edge) on desktop (not Android/iOS) 
* [M5Stack ATOM Echo Development Kit](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atom-echo-smart-speaker-dev-kit?ref=NabuCasa)
* USB-C cable to connect the ATOM Echo

## Getting everything ready
