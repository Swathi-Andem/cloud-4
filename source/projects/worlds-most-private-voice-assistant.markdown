## Required material

* Home Assistant 2023.5 or later
* An [analog phone](#about-the-analog-phone) with an RJ11 socket
* An analog telephone adapter 
  [Grandstream HT801](https://amzn.to/40k7mRa)
  * includes a 5&nbsp;V power adapter and an Ethernet cable
* RJ11 phone cable to connect the phone to the Grandstream
* [Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.nabucasa.com) or a manually configured [Assist Pipeline](/integrations/assist_pipeline)

## Setting up Grandstream

1. Connect the RJ11 cable from the phone to the green socket on the Grandstream.
   ![Grandstream HT801 ports](/images/assist/grandstream-ht801-interfaces.png)
1. Connect the Grandstream to your network: 
   * Plug the Ethernet cable into the blue socket and connect it to your router.
1. Start up the Grandstream.
   * Connect the power supply.
   * Once the Grandstream has booted, the two LEDs for power and Ethernet light up solid blue. The phone LED won't light up.
1. Identify the IP address of the Grandstream.
   * If your phone has a star * key, you can get your phone to tell you it's IP address:
      *  Press *** (press the star key three times) and wait until you hear *Enter the menu option*.
      *  Press 02 and the phone will tell you its IP address.
   * If your phone does not have a star * key, log onto your router to find the IP address.
1. Enter the IP address into a browser window and log onto the Grandstream *Device Configuration* software.
   * The default credentials are:
     * **Username**: `admin`
     * **Password**: `admin`  
   ![Login to Grandstream](/images/assist/grandstream_login.png)
1. Open the **FXS Port** tab and in the **Offhook Auto-Dial** field, enter the Home Assistant IP address in the following format:
   * \*47192\*168\*1\*100\*5060
   ![Define IP for autodial](/images/assist/grandstream_autodial.png)
   * Note: instead of 192\*168\*1\*100\*, enter the IP address of your Home Assistant instance.
   * At the bottom of the page, select **Apply**. 
   ![Define IP for autodial](/images/assist/grandstream_apply.png)
   * *Offhook Auto-Dial* means that when you pick up the phone, it directly calls Home Assistant. No need to dial.

## Setting up the phone in Home Assistant

1. In Home Assistant, go to {% my config_flow_start domain="voip" title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Add integration**" %} and add the **Voice over IP** integration.
    ![Voice over IP integration](/images/assist/voip_install.png)
1. Once you see the integration, pick up the phone.
   * You should now hear the message *This is your smart home speaking. Your phone is connected, but you must configure it within Home Assistant.*
   * The integration should now include a device and entities.
    ![Voice over IP integration with device and entities](/images/assist/voip_device_available.png)
   * Don't hear the voice? Try these [troubleshooting steps](/projects/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/#troubleshoot-grandstream).
1. Allow calls.
   * Calls from new devices are blocked by default since voice commands could be used to control sensitive devices, such as locks and garage doors.
   * In the **Voice over IP** integration, select the **device** link.
   * To allow this phone to control your smart home, under **Configuration**, enable **Allow calls**.   
   ![Voice over IP integration - allow calls](/images/assist/voip_configuration.png) 
1. Congratulations! You set up your analog phone to work with Home Assistant. Now pick up the phone and control your device. 
   * Say a [supported voice command](/docs/assist/builtin_sentences/). For example, *Turn off the light in the kitchen*.
   * You can also ask a question, such as
     *  *Is the front door locked?*
     *  *Which lights are on in the living room?*
   * Make sure you're using the area name as you defined it in Home Assistant. If you have a room called *bathroom*, the phrase *Turn on the lights in the bath* won't work.
   * Your command is not supported? [Add your own commands](/integrations/conversation/).

## Troubleshoot Grandstream

If you’re unable to call Home Assistant, confirm the following settings in your Grandstream device’s web interface.

1. On the **FXS Port** tab, check the **Preferred Vocoder** list. 
   * Make sure that **OPUS** is selected for one of the choices:
   ![Vocoder OPUS option](/images/assist/grandstream_vocoder.png) 
1. Under **OPUS Payload type**, make sure the value is `123`. It's the default option.
   ![Vocoder OPUS payload type](/images/assist/grandstream_opus_payload.png)
1. At the bottom of the page, select **Apply**.
1. Pick up the phone again and check if you hear the voice.

## About the analog phone

You can use any analog landline phone with an RJ11 socket.

The phone shown in the video by TheFes is a *Heemaf type 1955*, which was used by the Dutch telephone company PTT at the time.

The phone used during creation of this tutorial is a 1953 [*Tischstation Mod.29 HF-TR* by Autophon AG](https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/autophon_tischstation_mod29_hf_tr.html).
